686,2020-03-05 07:26:00+00:00,We encourage countries who want to know how much of their population is sick with #COVID19 to start testing people with symptoms.
687,2020-03-05 06:03:17+00:00,"We are eight weeks into this #COVID19 outbreak: yet we have identified the virus, we have the genetic sequence, PCR &amp; serological assay in use. This wealth of knowledge is unprecedented for a new disease. #coronavirus"
688,2020-03-04 16:59:47+00:00,"An increased consumption of energy dense foods, without an equal increase in #PhysicalActivity, leads to an unhealthy increase in weight. Decreased levels of physical activity will also result in an energy imbalance and lead to weight gain. #WorldObesityDay"

692,2020-03-04 13:08:56+00:00,Childhood obesity is one of the most serious public health challenges of the 21st century. Overweight children are likely to become obese adults. They are more likely to develop #diabetes and cardiovascular diseases at a younger age. #WorldObesityDay
693,2020-03-04 10:50:32+00:00,Regular physical activity helps maintain a healthy body. People should engage in adequate levels of #PhysicalActivity. At least 150 minutes of regular activity per week reduces the risk of: cardiovascular disease diabetes colon cancer breast cancer
694,2020-03-04 09:28:07+00:00,"Eating a healthy diet can help prevent #obesity. People can: maintain a healthy weight limit total fat intake increase consumption of fruit, vegetables, pulses, whole grains and nuts limit the intake of free sugars and salt http://bit.ly/387Ssm3"

696,2020-03-04 07:44:23+00:00,"Overweight & obesity are major risk factors for a number of chronic diseases, including: diabetes cardiovascular diseases cancer Once considered a problem only in high income countries, overweight &amp; obesity are now on the rise in low- and middle-income countries."
697,2020-03-04 06:23:24+00:00,Today is #WorldObesityDay. Worldwide obesity has nearly tripled since 1975. Most of the 's population live in countries where overweight &amp; obesity kills more people than underweight. Obesity is PREVENTABLE and TREATABLE. http://bit.ly/387Ssm3
698,2020-03-03 21:25:52+00:00,"Healthcare workers rely on personal protective equipment to protect themselves and their patients from being infected and infecting others. Shortages are leaving doctors, nurses and other frontline workers dangerously ill-equipped to care for #COVID19 patients #coronavirus"
699,2020-03-03 21:07:21+00:00,"Severe and mounting disruption to the global supply of personal protective equipment – caused by rising demand, panic buying, hoarding and misuse – is putting lives at risk from the new #coronavirus and other infectious diseases http://bit.ly/2PH5TTC #COVID19"

704,2020-03-03 16:56:53+00:00,Sharing is caring! We call on everyone to follow these and share with loved ones during #COVID19 
705,2020-03-03 16:13:38+00:00,"""Once again, this is a question of solidarity. This cannot be solved by WHO alone, or one industry alone. It requires all of us working together to ensure all countries can protect the people who protect the rest of us""-@DrTedros #COVID19 #coronavirus"
706,2020-03-03 16:13:16+00:00,"""We have called on governments to develop incentives for manufacturers to ramp up production. This includes easing restrictions on the export & distribution of personal protective equipment & other medical supplies""-@DrTedros #COVID19 #coronavirus"
707,2020-03-03 16:12:46+00:00,"""We continue to call on manufacturers to urgently increase production to meet this demand & guarantee supplies""-@DrTedros #COVID19 #coronavirus"
708,2020-03-03 16:12:09+00:00,"""We’re working with governments, manufacturers & the Pandemic Supply Chain Network to boost production & secure supplies for critically affected & at-risk countries. , it is estimated that personal protective equipment supplies need to be increased by 40%""-@DrTedros #COVID19"
709,2020-03-03 16:10:55+00:00,"""WHO estimates that each month 89m medical masks will be required for the #COVID19 response; 76m examination gloves &amp; 1.6m goggles. WHO has guidelines on how to rationalize the use of personal protective equipment in health facilities &amp; manage supply chains effectively""-@DrTedros"
710,2020-03-03 16:09:55+00:00,"""Supplies can take months to deliver, market manipulation is widespread & stocks are often sold to the highest bidder. WHO has shipped nearly half a million sets of personal protective equipment to 27 countries, but supplies are rapidly depleting""-@DrTedros #COVID19 #coronavirus"
711,2020-03-03 16:09:22+00:00,"""We can’t stop #COVID19 without protecting #healthworkers. Prices of surgical masks have increased six-fold, N95 respirators have more than trebled &amp; gowns cost twice as much""-@DrTedros #coronavirus"
712,2020-03-03 16:08:24+00:00,"""Shortages are leaving doctors, nurses & other frontline #healthworkers dangerously ill-equipped to care for #COVID19 patients, due to limited access to supplies such as gloves, medical masks, respirators, goggles, face shields, gowns &amp; aprons""-@DrTedros #coronavirus"
713,2020-03-03 16:07:43+00:00,"""We are concerned that countries’ abilities to respond are being compromised by the severe & increasing disruption to the global supply of personal protective equipment – caused by rising demand, hoarding & misuse""-@DrTedros #COVID19 #coronavirus"
714,2020-03-03 16:07:16+00:00,"""Because #COVID19 is also a respiratory pathogen, those systems can, should and are being adapted for COVID-19""-@DrTedros #coronavirus"
715,2020-03-03 16:06:49+00:00,"""These differences mean we can’t treat #COVID19 exactly the same way we treat flu. But there are enough similarities to mean that countries are not starting from scratch. For decades, many countries have invested in building up their systems to detect &amp; respond to flu""-@DrTedros"
716,2020-03-03 16:05:22+00:00,"""Fourth, we don’t even talk about containment for seasonal flu – it’s just not possible. But it is possible for #COVID19. We don’t bother with contact tracing for seasonal flu – but countries should do it for COVID-19, because it will prevent infections &amp; save lives""-@DrTedros"
717,2020-03-03 16:04:54+00:00,"""Third, we have vaccines & therapeutics for seasonal flu, but at the moment there is no vaccine & no specific treatment for #COVID19. However, clinical trials of therapeutics are now being done &amp; more than 20 vaccines are in development""-@DrTedros #coronavirus"
718,2020-03-03 16:04:23+00:00,"""Globally, about 3.4% of reported #COVID19 cases have died. By comparison, seasonal flu generally kills far fewer than 1% of those infected""-@DrTedros #coronavirus"
719,2020-03-03 16:04:00+00:00,"The second major difference is that #COVID19 causes more severe disease than seasonal influenza. While many people globally have built up immunity to seasonal flu strains, COVID-19 is a new #coronavirus to which no one has immunity""-@DrTedros"
720,2020-03-03 16:03:31+00:00,"""WHO has developed protocols on how these studies should be done, and we encourage all countries to do these studies and share their data""-@DrTedros #COVID19 #coronavirus"
721,2020-03-03 16:03:12+00:00,"""The only way to be sure is by looking for #COVID19 antibodies in large numbers of people, and several countries are now doing those studies. This will give us further insight into the extent of infection in populations over time""-@DrTedros #coronavirus"
722,2020-03-03 16:02:53+00:00,"""Countries such as , , &amp; elsewhere have found very few cases of #COVID19 among such samples – or no cases at all""-@DrTedros #coronavirus"

Some countries are looking for cases of COVID-19 using surveillance systems for influenza &amp; other respiratory diseases""-@DrTedros #coronavirus"
724,2020-03-03 16:02:12+00:00,"""However, there are some important differences. First, #COVID19 does not transmit as efficiently as influenza. With influenza, people who are infected but not yet sick are major drivers of transmission, which does not appear to be the case for COVID-19""-@DrTedros #coronavirus"
725,2020-03-03 16:01:52+00:00,"""This #coronavirus is not SARS, it’s not MERS &amp; it’s not influenza. It is a unique virus with unique characteristics. Both #COVID19 &amp; influenza cause respiratory disease &amp; spread the same way, via small droplets of fluid from the nose &amp; mouth of someone who is sick""-@DrTedros"
726,2020-03-03 16:01:41+00:00,"""We understand that people are afraid & uncertain. Fear is a natural human response to any threat, esp. when it’s a threat we don’t completely understand. But as we get more data, we are understanding this #coronavirus &amp; the disease it causes, more &amp; more""-@DrTedros #COVID19"
