2020-05-18 11:52:07+00:00, the pandemic is asking us two fundamental questions what sort of world do we want and what sort of who do we want the answer to the first question will determine the answer to the second 
2020-05-18 11:51:52+00:00, the pandemic has tested strengthened and strained the bonds of fellowship between nations but it has not broken them 
2020-05-18 11:51:41+00:00,the pandemic is posing a similar threat not just to human health but to the human spirit we have a long road ahead in our struggle against this virus 
2020-05-18 11:51:29+00:00, years ago the nations of the world came together under the banner of who to rid the world of they showed that when solidarity triumphs over ideology anything is possible 
2020-05-18 11:50:55+00:00, more than ever illustrates why investing in health must be at the centre of development health is not a reward for development it s a prerequisite health is not a cost it s an investment health is a pathway to security prosperity and peace 
2020-05-18 11:50:01+00:00, is not just a global health emergency it s a vivid demonstration of the fact that there is no health security without resilient health systems or without addressing the social economic commercial and environmental determinants of health 
2020-05-18 11:47:26+00:00, however much work remains to be done even before the world was off track for the the pandemic threatens to set us back even further it exploits and exacerbates existing gaps in gender equality poverty hunger and more 
2020-05-18 11:47:05+00:00, in the coming year we will launch the who academy to provide training for millions more around the the who foundation will be launched to broaden whos donor base i am proud of the made in these amp many other areas 
2020-05-18 11:46:35+00:00, we ve expanded access to prevention testing and treatment for hiv tuberculosis malaria hepatitis c hypertension diabetes cancer and more to keep the safe who has investigated when necessary amp responded to more than events in countries 
2020-05-18 11:45:49+00:00, on universal health coverage the world came together last year to endorse the political declaration on uhc an unprecedented commitment to the ideal of 
2020-05-18 11:45:36+00:00, on healthy populations we ve made important progress to improve the air people breathe the food they eat the water they drink the roads they use and the conditions in which they live and work 
2020-05-18 11:45:20+00:00, the who results report launched today provides a comprehensive picture of what who its member states and partners have achieved in the past two years 
2020-05-18 11:45:03+00:00, at its heart are the ambitious triple billion targets billion more people enjoying better health and well being billion more people benefiting from universal health coverage and billion more people better protected from health emergencies 
2020-05-18 11:44:24+00:00, since my election at this assembly three years ago i have made a priority of transforming who into an organization that is agile and responsive focused on outcomes and impact 
2020-05-18 11:44:06+00:00, to be successful we must all commit to mutual ownership accountability one way to do that proposed by the africa group is through a system of universal periodic review in which countries agree to a regular transparent review of each nation s preparedness 
2020-05-18 11:43:41+00:00, i am calling on all nations to invest in strengthening and implementing the many tools at our disposal especially the global treaty that underpins global health security the international health regulations 
2020-05-18 11:43:27+00:00, today i am calling on all nations to resolve that they will do everything it takes to ensure that the pandemic is never repeated 
2020-05-18 11:43:11+00:00, the does not lack the tools the science or the resources to make it safer from pandemics what it has lacked is the sustained commitment to use the tools the science and the resources it has that must change and it must change today 
2020-05-18 11:42:46+00:00, the time has come to weave together the disparate strands of global health security into an unbreakable chain a comprehensive framework for epidemic pandemic preparedness 
2020-05-18 11:42:32+00:00, the can no longer afford the short term amnesia that has characterised its response to health security for too long 
2020-05-18 11:42:10+00:00, the world doesn t need another plan another system another mechanism another committee or another organization it needs to strengthen implement and finance the systems and organizations it has including who 
2020-05-18 11:41:51+00:00, and the outbreak of and led to the establishment of the pandemic emergency financing facility the who emergencies programme and the independent oversight advisory committee 
2020-05-18 11:41:38+00:00, the sars outbreak gave rise to the revision of the international health regulations in the h n pandemic saw the creation of the pandemic influenza preparedness framework 
2020-05-18 11:41:25+00:00, reviews after sars the h n pandemic the west african ebola epidemic highlighted shortcomings in global health security made numerous recommendations for countries to address those gaps some were implemented others went unheeded 
2020-05-18 11:41:10+00:00, if there is anything positive to come from the pandemic it must be a safer and more resilient world 
2020-05-18 11:41:00+00:00, whatever lessons there are to learn from the pandemic the greatest failing would be to not learn from them amp to leave the in the same vulnerable state it was before 
2020-05-18 11:40:50+00:00, one thing is abundantly clear the must never be the same we do not need a review to tell us that we must all do everything in our power to ensure this never happens again 
2020-05-18 11:40:35+00:00, i will initiate an independent evaluation at the earliest appropriate moment to review experience gained lessons learned to make recommendations to improve national global pandemic preparedness and response 
2020-05-18 11:39:52+00:00, we welcome the proposed resolution before which calls for a step wise process of impartial independent amp comprehensive evaluation to be truly comprehensive such an evaluation must encompass the entirety of the response by all actors in good faith 
2020-05-18 11:39:29+00:00, in fact the existing independent accountability mechanisms are already in operation the independent oversight advisory committee has today published its st report on the pandemic with several recommendations for both the secretariat amp member states 
2020-05-18 11:39:00+00:00, we all have lessons to learn from the pandemic every country and every organization must examine its response and learn from its experience who is committed to transparency accountability and continuous improvement 
2020-05-18 11:38:30+00:00, we ve informed engaged empowered people fought the infodemic combating myths with reliable information called consistently for the two essential ingredients for conquering national unity amp global solidarity 
2020-05-18 11:38:10+00:00, weve driven research and development through the solidarity trial called for equitable access to vaccines diagnostics and therapeutics through the act accelerator 
2020-05-18 11:37:57+00:00, weve shipped diagnostics personal protective equipment oxygen other medical supplies to countries trained more than million in languages 
2020-05-18 11:37:42+00:00, we ve provided technical guidance strategic advice based on the latest science experience supported countries to adapt implement that guidance 
2020-05-18 11:37:17+00:00, we notified countries issued guidance for within days amp declared a global health emergency our highest level of alert on the th of jan at the time there were less than cases amp no deaths outside 
2020-05-18 11:36:39+00:00, since day one who has stood shoulder to shoulder with countries in these darkest of hours who sounded the alarm early and we sounded it often 
2020-05-18 11:36:07+00:00, it takes hard work fidelity to science learning and adapting as you go and difficult decisions 
2020-05-18 11:35:57+00:00, the countries that have done well have done it all this is the comprehensive approach that who has called for consistently there is no silver bullet there is no simple solution there is no panacea there is no one size fits all approach 
2020-05-18 11:35:29+00:00, weve learned an enormous amount about how to prevent infections save lives there is no single action that has made the difference not testing alone not contact tracing alone not isolation quarantine hand hygiene or physical distancing alone 
2020-05-18 11:35:01+00:00, early serology studies are painting a consistent picture the proportion of the population with tell tale antibodies is no more than in most places less than in other words the majority of the s population remains susceptible to the virus 
2020-05-18 11:34:26+00:00, some are now assessing how to ease the restrictions that have exacted such a heavy social economic toll moving too fast without putting in place the public health architecture to detect suppress transmission runs a real risk of handicapping their own recovery 
2020-05-18 11:34:10+00:00, some countries are succeeding in preventing widespread community transmission have issued orders amp imposed severe social restrictions to suppress community transmission are still bracing for the worst 
2020-05-18 11:33:13+00:00, low income countries small island developing states and those suffering from violence and conflict are trying to confront this threat in the most challenging of circumstances 
2020-05-18 11:33:02+00:00, in less than months the pandemic has encircled the globe all countries have faced challenges in coming to grips with this virus rich and poor large and small 
2020-05-18 11:32:37+00:00, months ago it wouldve been inconceivable to most that the s biggest cities would fall eerily quiet shops restaurants schools amp workplaces would be closed global travel would grind to a standstill simply shaking hands could be life threatening 
2020-05-18 11:31:52+00:00, for all the economic military and technological might of nations we have been humbled by this very small microbe if is teaching us anything it s humility 
2020-05-18 11:31:30+00:00, any efforts to make our safer are doomed to fail unless they address the critical interface between people amp pathogens amp the existential threat of that is making our earth less habitable 
2020-05-18 11:31:15+00:00, the pandemic is a reminder of the intimate amp delicate relationship between people and planet 
2020-05-18 11:31:01+00:00, has highlighted our strengths and our vulnerabilities science has been hailed and scorned nations have come together as never before and geopolitical divisions have been thrown into sharp relief 
2020-05-18 11:30:38+00:00, the pandemic has brought out the best and worst of humanity fortitude and fear solidarity and suspicion rapport and recrimination this contagion exposes the fault lines inequalities injustices and contradictions of our modern world 
2020-05-18 11:30:14+00:00, lives and livelihoods have been lost or upended hundreds of millions of people have lost their jobs fear and uncertainty abound the global economy is headed for its sharpest contraction since the great depression 
2020-05-18 11:29:50+00:00, the health impacts of the pandemic extend far beyond the sickness amp death caused by the virus itself and yet this is so much more than a health crisis 
2020-05-18 11:29:14+00:00, more than and a half million cases of have now been reported to who amp more than people have lost their lives but numbers don t even begin to tell the story of the pandemic each loss of life leaves a scar for families communities amp nations

2020-05-11 15:59:48+00:00, only together can we get through the pandemic in national unity and global solidarity 
2020-05-11 15:59:48+00:00, this new partnership is another great example of solidarity that builds on the solidarity flights solidarity trials and access to tools accelerator which all aim to ensure the latest health innovations are reaching those communities that need them most 
2020-05-11 15:59:48+00:00, has exposed the uneven distribution of life saving medical equipment across the world tomorrow the tech access partnership will be launched to increase local production of essential health technologies like masks and ventilators in developing countries 
2020-05-11 15:58:39+00:00, even relatively short term interruptions to treatment pose a significant threat to a person s health and potential to transmit 
2020-05-11 15:58:39+00:00, despite attention being focused on the pandemic we must still ensure that global supplies of tests and treatments for both and reach the countries and communities that need them most 
2020-05-11 15:57:39+00:00, this could effectively set the back by more than decade to when k deaths were observed in the region this is an avoidable worst case scenario amp not a prediction the model acts as a wake up call to identify ways to sustain all vital health services 
2020-05-11 15:57:39+00:00, the group s worst case scenario a month disruption of antiretroviral therapy suggests that there could be extra deaths from related illnesses including from in sub saharan africa over the next year 
2020-05-11 15:55:15+00:00, today saw the release of new modeling on by the who and it highlights the importance of taking immediate steps to minimise interruptions in health services and supplies of antiretroviral drugs during the covid pandemic 
2020-05-11 15:53:42+00:00, workplaces should develop action plans for prevention mitigation of as part of their overall business plan the plan should also include measures for protecting health safety amp security in re opening closing amp modifying workplaces 
2020-05-11 15:53:42+00:00, who issued detailed new workplace guidelines which recommend all places of work carry out a risk assessment for workers potential exposure to this includes the implementation of measures to prevent the spread of the virus 
2020-05-11 15:53:41+00:00, last week i also spoke to the and the about the reopening of work places and how to do this safely 
2020-05-11 15:51:00+00:00, when reflecting on the decision to reopen schools the local government should assess the capacity of the schools to maintain infection prevention and control measures 
2020-05-11 15:51:00+00:00, the epidemiology of where the school is geographically located needs to be considered the ability to maintain covid prevention and control measures within the school setting 
2020-05-11 15:51:00+00:00, on children going back to school decision makers should reflect on a number of key factors when deciding on whether and how to reopen schools a clear understanding about current transmission and severity of the virus in children is needed 
2020-05-11 15:48:47+00:00, in this vein new guidance was released over the weekend regarding both school and work places reopening 
2020-05-11 15:43:52+00:00, who is working closely with governments to ensure that key public health measures remain in place to deal with the challenge of lifting lockdowns until there is a vaccine the comprehensive package of measures is our most effective set of tools to tackle 
2020-05-11 15:43:10+00:00, early serological studies reflect that a relatively low percentage of the population has antibodies to which means most of the population is still susceptible to the virus 
2020-05-11 15:42:40+00:00, in wuhan the st cluster of cases since their lockdown was lifted was identified has also reported an increase in cases since an easing of restrictions fortunately all countries have systems in place to detect and respond to a resurgence in cases 
2020-05-11 15:42:40+00:00, however even with three positive answers releasing lockdowns is both complex and difficult over the weekend we saw signs of the challenges that may lie ahead in bars and clubs were shut as a confirmed case led to many contacts being traced 
2020-05-11 15:41:03+00:00, is the public health surveillance system able to detect and manage the cases and their contacts and identify a resurgence of cases these three questions can help determine whether a lockdown can be released slowly or not 
2020-05-11 15:40:22+00:00, further guidance was published that outlines the key questions countries should ask prior to the lifting of lockdowns is the epidemic under control is the health system able to cope with a resurgence of cases that may arise after relaxing certain measures 
2020-05-11 15:38:27+00:00, i ve previously outlined the six criteria countries need to consider before lifting orders and other restrictions 
2020-05-11 15:36:26+00:00, therefore to protect lives and livelihoods a slow steady lifting of lockdowns is key to both stimulating economies while also keeping a vigilant eye on the virus so that control measures can be quickly implemented if an upswing in cases is identified 
2020-05-11 15:36:00+00:00, the good news is that there has been a great deal of success in slowing the virus saving lives such strong measures have come at a cost we recognize the serious socio economic impact of the lockdowns which have had a detrimental effect on many people s lives 
2020-05-11 15:34:52+00:00, many have used the time to ramp up their ability to test trace isolate and care for patients which is the best way to track the virus slow the spread and take pressure off health systems 
2020-05-11 15:34:33+00:00, countries put these stringent measures in place sometimes called lockdowns in response to intense transmission 
2020-05-11 15:33:13+00:00, there have now been more than four million cases of across the world over the past week several countries have started lifting orders and other restrictions in a phased way

2020-05-08 15:36:48+00:00, as we reflect today on the eradication of we re reminded of what is possible when nations come together to confront a common foe

2020-05-08 15:25:02+00:00, the decisive factor in the victory over was global solidarity at the height of the cold war the soviet union and the united states of america joined forces to conquer a common enemy they recognized that viruses do not respect nations or ideologies 
2020-05-08 15:24:31+00:00, but although a vaccine was crucial for ending it was not enough on its own after all the vaccine was first developed by edward jenner in it took another years for smallpox to be eradicated 
2020-05-08 15:23:34+00:00, as you know who is now working with many partners to accelerate the development of a vaccine for which will be an essential tool for controlling transmission of the virus 
2020-05-08 15:22:50+00:00, the eradication campaign had one crucial tool that we don t have for yet a vaccine in fact the world s first vaccine 
2020-05-08 15:20:44+00:00, many of the basic public health tools that were used successfully then are the same tools that have been used to respond to and to disease surveillance case finding contact tracing and mass communication campaigns to inform affected populations

2020-05-06 15:35:32+00:00, if we learn anything from it must be that investing in health now will save lives later history will judge all of us not only on whether we got through this pandemic but also on the lessons we learned and the actions we took once it was over 
2020-05-06 15:33:33+00:00, as we work on responding to the pandemic we must also work harder to prepare for the next one now is an opportunity to lay the foundations for resilient health systems around the that includes systems to prepare prevent amp respond to emerging pathogens 
2020-05-06 15:32:54+00:00, the pandemic will eventually recede but there can be no going back to business as usual we cannot continue to rush to fund panic but let preparedness go by the wayside 
2020-05-06 15:32:31+00:00, the spends around t on health each year almost of global gdp but the best investments are in promoting health amp preventing disease at the level which will save lives amp save money prevention is not only better than cure it s cheaper 
2020-05-06 15:31:24+00:00, gaps like these don t just undermine the health of individuals families and communities they also put global security and economic development at risk 
2020-05-06 15:30:58+00:00, and yet on current trends more than billion people will lack access to essential health services by including the ability to see a health worker access to essential medicines and running water in hospitals 
2020-05-06 15:30:33+00:00, strong and resilient health systems are the best defence not only against outbreaks and pandemics but also against the multiple health threats that people around the world face every day 
2020-05-06 15:30:08+00:00, the pandemic has highlighted the importance of strong national and sub national health systems as the foundation of global health security and universal health coverage 
2020-05-06 15:29:32+00:00, the risk of returning to lockdown remains very real if countries do not manage the transition extremely carefully 
2020-05-06 15:29:16+00:00, that preventive measures are in place in workplaces schools and other places where it s essential for people to go that importation risks can be managed that communities are fully educated engaged and empowered to adjust to the new norm 
2020-05-06 15:28:17+00:00, that health system capacities are in place to detect isolate test and treat every case and trace every contact that outbreak risks are minimized in special settings like health facilities and nursing homes 
2020-05-06 15:27:19+00:00, as more more countries consider how to ease so called lockdown restrictions i want to reiterate the criteria that who recommends countries consider that surveillance is strong cases are declining amp transmission is controlled 
2020-05-06 15:25:06+00:00, importantly the framework takes a health first approach recognizing that strong and resilient health systems must be the foundation of recovery in all countries 
2020-05-06 15:24:46+00:00, today s guidance complements the framework for socio economic response to published last week the framework lays out a recovery roadmap for countries to protect lives amp livelihoods get businesses amp economies up amp running again as soon as possible 
2020-05-06 15:23:04+00:00, we must address this now in the long term by prioritizing diagnosis care for those who are most at risk this is not only the right thing to do it s the smart thing to do we cannot end the pandemic until we address the inequalities that are fueling it 
2020-05-06 15:22:12+00:00, it s also vital that countries pay careful attention to the most vulnerable members of their societies crises can exacerbate existing inequalities which is demonstrated in higher rates of hospitalization death among certain populations in many countries 
2020-05-06 15:21:40+00:00, for example it suggests using telemedicine wherever possible and leaving insecticide treated nets for at the door of households instead of asking people to collect them from a central location 
2020-05-06 15:21:11+00:00, it includes practical recommendations for countries on sustaining essential services at the community level leveraging community for the response to while keeping them safe amp advice for how to adapt services for specific diseases amp age groups 
2020-05-06 15:20:36+00:00, today who and the have published guidance for countries on how to maintain community based health care in the context of 
2020-05-06 15:19:20+00:00, although professional play crucial roles in many countries trained members of the community play a vital role in delivering essential health services like vaccination pre natal screening amp the detection prevention amp management of many diseases 
2020-05-06 15:18:38+00:00, around the world the pandemic has caused severe disruption to essential health services including to community based health care 
2020-05-06 15:18:20+00:00, however even within regions and within countries we see divergent trends every country and every region needs a tailored approach but the impact of the pandemic goes far beyond the numbers of cases and deaths 
2020-05-06 15:17:55+00:00, although the number of cases reported from western europe is declining more cases are being reported every day from eastern europe africa south east asia the eastern mediterranean and the americas 
2020-05-06 15:17:32+00:00, but these are not just numbers every single case is a mother a father a son a daughter a brother sister or friend 
2020-05-06 15:17:14+00:00, more than million cases of and almost deaths have now been reported to who since the beginning of april an average of around new cases have been reported to who every day

2020-04-22 16:06:47+00:00, in addition who has sent surge teams to countries to strengthen surveillance and provide advice on infection prevention how to treat patients risk communication lab capacity data management and much much more 
2020-04-22 16:06:23+00:00, who has staff in countries all over the world working directly with governments scientists and partners to coordinate national preparedness and response plans and to implement them 
2020-04-22 16:06:00+00:00, through thousands of hours of discussion we have exchanged first hand experience and debated the science to generate the advice that we make available to all countries we then work with countries to turn that guidance into action 
2020-04-22 16:05:38+00:00, one of who s core functions is to provide evidence based technical advice to countries this is not something we do alone we work with thousands of experts to collect analyze amp synthesize the best science amp turn it into guidance that we give back to countries

2020-04-22 16:00:00+00:00, countries that don t do these six central things and do them consistently will see more cases and more lives will be lost to be clear who s advice is to find test every suspected case not every person in a population 
2020-04-22 15:59:17+00:00, the same public health measures we have been advocating since the beginning of the pandemic must remain the backbone of the response in all countries find isolate test care for every case trace quarantine every contact educate engage empower your people 
2020-04-22 15:57:43+00:00, people understandably want to get on with their lives that s what who wants too is working for all day every day but the will not amp cannot go back to the way things were there must be a new normal a that is healthier safer and better prepared 
2020-04-22 15:56:22+00:00, one of the greatest dangers we face now is complacency people in countries with orders are understandably frustrated with being confined to their homes for weeks on end 
2020-04-22 15:56:07+00:00, early evidence suggests most of the s population remains susceptible that means epidemics can easily re ignite 
2020-04-22 15:55:24+00:00, there s no question that orders and other physical distancing measures have successfully suppressed transmission in many countries but this virus remains extremely dangerous 
2020-04-22 15:54:42+00:00, and some that were affected early in the pandemic are now starting to see a resurgence in cases make no mistake we have a long way to go this virus will be with us for a long time 
2020-04-22 15:54:20+00:00, most of the epidemics in western europe appear to be stable or declining although numbers are low we see worrying upward trends in africa central a south america eastern europe most countries are still in the early stages of their epidemics 
2020-04-22 15:53:44+00:00, globally almost million cases of have now been reported to who and more than deaths we see different trends in different regions and even within regions 
2020-04-22 12:52:54+00:00,fasting during healthy individuals ok to fast as usual covid patients consider religious licenses on breaking the fast in consultation with doctors no studies of fasting amp risk of covid infection have been performed 
2020-04-22 12:29:11+00:00,practice physical distancing strictly maintaining a distance of at least m between people at all times using culturally amp religiously sanctioned greetings that avoid physical contacts waving nodding placing hand over the heart stopping large gatherings 
2020-04-22 11:23:53+00:00,tobacco lobbyists have tried to manipulate policymaking to get tobacco shops listed as essential amp offer free delivery of tobacco products to people in quarantine smokers likely face more severe symptoms if infected leading to hospitalizations amp premature deaths 
2020-04-22 10:36:59+00:00, we urge you to pay careful attention to ensuring that essential public health services continue safely and effectively who remains committed to standing with all of you in solidarity to fight the virus and save lives

2020-04-22 10:35:53+00:00, id like to leave you with requests response demands a whole of govt approach as ministers of health you play a vital central role but you cannot do it alone so continuing with the whole of govt approach will be very important to beating this virus 
2020-04-22 10:33:39+00:00, we are helping to consolidate lessons learned to adjust and fine tune our collective response to the pandemic the recently released preparedness and response strategy incorporates the most recent learning from country experiences from across the globe 
2020-04-22 10:33:10+00:00, we are coordinating a vast range of research endeavours including the solidarity trial which is investigating different therapeutic options for the treatment of 
2020-04-22 10:32:47+00:00, who has produced multiple technical guidance documents on all aspects of the response amp our online and remote trainings have been accessed by more than million and we will expand it to train millions more 
2020-04-22 10:32:07+00:00, in spite of this clear progress i am of course asking you to do more as always who is here to assist both at headquarters and regional levels and of course at the country level 
2020-04-22 10:31:32+00:00, weve been impressed by the progress being made the active outreach to almost m people in through the national campaign the rapid scaling up of testing in the commitment to establishing temporary isolation units in the use of polio assets in amp in 
2020-04-22 10:28:48+00:00, we know that many countries are facing acute shortages of personal protective equipment who is working to increase supply so far we have shipped diagnostic tests almost m items of personal protective equipment to countries in the region more is on the way 
2020-04-22 10:28:05+00:00, protecting is one of the most important responsibilities of the health system it s vital to protect esp those who work in conflict affected areas to do that we must ensure they have the tools they need to do their jobs safely amp effectively 
2020-04-22 10:25:20+00:00, home isolation should be considered as a last resort as experience demonstrates that adherence is weak and transmission to other household members is common 
2020-04-22 10:21:46+00:00, confirmed patients who have mild or do not require hospitalization should be admitted to temporary isolation facilities managed properly with infection prevention and control measures in place 
2020-04-22 10:20:43+00:00, early isolation of all cases is perhaps the most important public health measure in controlling the spread of 
2020-04-22 10:20:14+00:00, all of us need to invest further in the collection analysis and utilization of epidemiological data aggregated data should be shared with who to inform country specific advice and regional analysis and response 
2020-04-22 10:16:20+00:00, in places where people live in overcrowded conditions where ppl must work every day to put food on the table orders may cause significant unintended harm govs must impose physical distancing restrictions carefully adapting for each country amp community 
2020-04-22 10:13:49+00:00, from the experience of other countries weve learned the value of physical distancing incl orders amp suspension of mass gatherings this approach can prevent a handful of cases from becoming clusters amp prevent clusters from becoming community transmission 
2020-04-22 10:12:50+00:00, the proven public health measures of early detection testing isolation treatment of cases amp tracing amp quarantining of contacts should form the central pillar of the response 
2020-04-22 10:12:14+00:00, the eastern mediterranean still has an opportunity to slow the transmission of but the window is rapidly closing slowing the spread is critical in order to give you time to mount a comprehensive response 
2020-04-22 10:11:43+00:00, we re especially concerned about the potential impact of the in countries that have suffered from years of conflict amp fragility 
2020-04-22 10:10:47+00:00, the epidemic in now appears to be waning but most other countries in the region are seeing increasing numbers of new infections every day 
2020-04-22 10:09:51+00:00, the pandemic is showing that no country or region is immune almost cases and more than deaths have been reported to so far at the eastern mediterranean region ministerial meeting on covid

2020-04-13 15:35:09+00:00, our global connectedness means the risk of re introduction and resurgence of will continue ultimately the development and delivery of a safe and effective vaccine will be needed to fully interrupt transmission 
2020-04-13 15:33:50+00:00, as the pandemic has spread its public health and socioeconomic impacts have been profound and have disproportionately affected the vulnerable many populations have already experienced a lack of access to routine essential health services 
2020-04-13 15:33:22+00:00, countries must balance between measures that address the mortality caused by and from other diseases due to overwhelmed health systems as well as the social economic impacts 
2020-04-13 15:32:50+00:00, communities are fully educated engaged amp empowered to adjust to the new norm every country should implement a comprehensive set of measures to slow down transmission amp save lives with the aim of reaching a steady state of low level or no transmission 
2020-04-13 15:32:50+00:00, outbreak risks are minimized in special settings like health facilities amp nursing homes preventive measures are in place in workplaces schools amp other places where it s essential for people to go importation risks can be managed 
2020-04-13 15:32:50+00:00, the new strategy it includes criteria for countries as they consider lifting restrictions that transmission is controlled health system capacities are in place to detect test isolate amp treat every case amp trace every contact 
2020-04-13 15:32:49+00:00, to support countries in making these decisions who will tomorrow be publishing its updated strategic advice the new strategy summarizes what we ve learned and charts the way forward 
2020-04-13 15:28:43+00:00, we also call on all countries to ensure that where measures are used they must not be at the expense of human rights each government must assess their situation while protecting all their citizens amp especially the most vulnerable 
2020-04-13 15:27:37+00:00, as ive said many times physical distancing restrictions are only part of the equation there are many other basic public health measures that need to be put in place 
2020-04-13 15:26:37+00:00, meanwhile schools have closed for an estimated billion children this has halted their education opened some to increased risk of abuse and deprived many of their primary source of food 
2020-04-13 15:26:37+00:00, how do you survive a lockdown when you depend on your daily labor to eat news reports from around the world describe how many people are in danger of being left without access to food 
2020-04-13 15:25:48+00:00, in countries with large poor populations the orders amp other restrictions used in high income countries may not be practical many poor people migrants amp refugees are already living in overcrowded conditions with few resources amp little access to health care 
2020-04-13 15:24:19+00:00, but while some countries are considering how to ease restrictions others are considering whether to introduce them especially many low and middle income countries in africa asia and latin america 
2020-04-13 15:23:46+00:00, that means control measures must be lifted slowly and with control it cannot happen all at once control measures can only be lifted if the right public health measures are in place including significant capacity for contact tracing 
2020-04-13 15:23:16+00:00, we know that in some countries cases are doubling every to days however while covid accelerates very fast it decelerates much more slowly in other words the way down is much slower than the way up 
2020-04-13 15:22:35+00:00, we know that the can spread more easily in crowded environments like nursing homes we know that early case finding testing isolating caring for every case amp tracing every contact is essential for stopping transmission 
2020-04-13 15:21:56+00:00, evidence from several countries is giving us a clearer picture about this virus how it behaves how to stop it how to treat it we know that spreads fast amp we know that it is deadly times deadlier than the virus responsible for the flu pandemic 
2020-04-13 15:19:47+00:00, as we ve said many times before this is a new virus the first pandemic caused by a we re all learning all the time amp adjusting our strategy based on the latest available evidence we can only say what we know amp we can only act on what we know 
2020-04-13 15:19:08+00:00, in both cases these decisions must be based first on foremost on protecting human health and guided by what we know about the and how it behaves since the beginning this has been an area of intense focus for who 
2020-04-13 15:18:45+00:00, some countries and communities have now endured several weeks of social and economic restrictions some countries are considering when they can lift these restrictions others are considering whether and when to introduce them

2020-04-10 15:48:19+00:00, this system will consist of hubs in belgium china ethiopia ghana malaysia panama south africa the united arab emirates we estimate this supply chain may need to cover more than of the world s needs in the acute phase of the pandemic 
2020-04-10 15:47:40+00:00, this initiative will be coordinated by who and building on existing collaboration between multiple partners from within and outside the

2020-04-10 15:45:44+00:00, to support countries who has launched three tools to help managers and planners calculate the supplies and equipment that will be needed for the increase in patients 
2020-04-10 15:45:12+00:00, the evidence shows when wear personal protective equipment ppe the right way infections can be prevented that makes it even more important that health workers are able to access the masks gloves gowns amp other ppe they need to do their jobs safely 
2020-04-10 15:43:21+00:00, within common problems are the late recognition of or lack of training or inexperience in dealing with respiratory pathogens many are also being exposed to large numbers of patients in long shifts with inadequate rest periods 
2020-04-10 15:42:26+00:00, when are at risk we re all at risk evidence from is helping us to understand why this is happening amp what we can do about it it shows that some health workers are actually being infected outside in their homes or communities 
2020-04-10 15:40:43+00:00, we are particularly concerned by the large numbers of infections reported among in some countries there are reports of up to of health workers being infected this is an alarming trend 
2020-04-10 15:39:05+00:00, preventive measures are in place in workplaces schools amp other essential places importation risks can be managed communities are fully aware and engaged in the transition 
2020-04-10 15:39:05+00:00, who is working with affected countries on strategies for gradually safely easing restrictions imp factors to consider are that transmission is controlled sufficient public health amp medical services are available outbreak risks in spec settings are minimized 
2020-04-10 15:35:39+00:00, at the same time lifting restrictions too quickly could lead to a deadly resurgence the way down can be as dangerous as the way up if not managed properly 
2020-04-10 15:35:15+00:00, i know that some countries are already planning the transition out of restrictions who wants to see restrictions lifted as much as anyone 
2020-04-10 15:34:21+00:00, the recent meeting of the expressed strong support for africa which must be expedited even though the numbers in africa are still relatively small but accelerating 
2020-04-10 15:33:52+00:00, as dr the regional director for said yesterday this means countries need to localize the response by urgently strengthening the existing public health and primary health care infrastructure in countries 
2020-04-10 15:33:10+00:00, we anticipate severe hardship for already overstretched health systems particularly in rural areas which normally lack the resources of those in cities 
2020-04-10 15:32:45+00:00, at the same time we ve seen an alarming acceleration in other countries i want to take a moment to highlight africa where we are seeing the spread of the to rural areas we are now seeing clusters of cases and community spread in more than countries 
2020-04-10 15:32:07+00:00, on a personal note i was pleased to see my friend is no longer in intensive care i wish him the best as i wish the best for everyone who is facing what he faced

2020-04-10 14:03:04+00:00,you can find information about autopsies in the document 
2020-04-10 13:59:12+00:00,it is a common myth that persons who have died of a communicable disease should be cremated but this is not true cremation is a matter of cultural choice and available resources 
2020-04-10 13:37:15+00:00,except in cases of hemorrhagic fevers such as ebola marburg and cholera dead bodies are generally not infectious 
2020-04-10 13:09:37+00:00,who has issued interim guidance on infection prevention and control for the safe management of a dead body in the context of 
2020-04-10 10:11:44+00:00, thank you all for your commitment support for harnessing the law to mitigate the current crisis to work towards a healthier safer fairer who s commitment is to serving all people in all countries to promote health keep the world safe amp serve the vulnerable 
2020-04-10 10:11:43+00:00, last year legislators from many countries at the congress in belgrade pledged to leverage the power of parliaments to make progress towards universal health coverage 
2020-04-10 10:08:37+00:00, around the world more and more countries have enshrined the right to health in their constitutions and more countries are enacting laws to make that right a reality 
2020-04-10 10:06:54+00:00, countries with strong health systems are the best placed to protect their people and their economies from the effects of health emergencies here too the rule of law has a central role to play 
2020-04-10 10:06:02+00:00, that is for who there is no higher priority than universal health coverage so that all people have access to essential health services without financial hardship 
2020-04-10 09:56:07+00:00, one day hopefully before too long this crisis will be behind us but billions of people will continue to face their own personal health crises every day of not having access to the essential health services they need of not being able to pay for those services 
2020-04-10 09:55:03+00:00, is disrupting our societies but it cannot and must not shake our foundations history will judge us not only on whether we get through this pandemic but the manner in which we did so 
2020-04-10 09:54:34+00:00, the restrictive measures governments are implementing are already having a massive impact on livelihoods we must plan for take appropriate measures to alleviate the economic impact of the pandemic 
2020-04-10 09:53:55+00:00, countries have to protect support the elderly refugees other vulnerable groups we re esp concerned by reports of an increasing trend in domestic violence linked to the measures this must be an area of focus for all countries 
2020-04-10 09:51:44+00:00, it is critical that governments reassure the population that once the crisis is over such measures will be discontinued and life can go back to normal 
2020-04-10 09:51:24+00:00, governments should be transparent with their populations inform them regularly on how measures are being implemented and on the intended duration of these measures 
2020-04-10 09:50:18+00:00, in implementing these measures there is a need to respect human rights dignity as provided by the intel health regulations by the european convention for the protection of human rights fundamental freedoms by the universal declaration of human rights 
2020-04-10 09:49:27+00:00, in this time of crisis these unprecedented measures are motivated by the desire to protect their populations by reducing the spread of the and thus flatten the curve 
2020-04-10 09:49:02+00:00, many countries have put in place very restrictive measures of physical distancing these include closing borders declaration of a national state of emergency lockdowns of cities or entire countries and closing schools and businesses 
2020-04-10 09:48:38+00:00, countries who have the heavy responsibility of accommodating these vulnerable populations must be given the necessary tools and resources to protect them and provide them with the support they need 
2020-04-10 09:48:16+00:00, populations in humanitarian settings are particularly at risk they have few resources and little access to health care and basic infrastructure physical distancing and hand washing may not be possible which puts whole communities at risk 
2020-04-10 09:47:34+00:00, the ihr provides an intl legal framework in order to be effective efficient domestic laws regulations must also frame the response they should be clearly articulated swiftly adopted implemented proportionate to the circumstances limited in their duration 
2020-04-10 09:46:31+00:00, rule of law has a critical role to play in fighting pandemic as countries work to contain and mitigate the virus many social challenges are arising which require legal regulatory and ethical responses 
2020-04-10 09:46:11+00:00, a key principle of the international health regulations is that they must be implemented with full respect for dignity human rights and the fundamental freedom of persons this is essential 
2020-04-10 09:45:43+00:00, the key purpose of the intl health regulations is to prevent respond to the intl spread of diseases while minimizing interference with intl traffic which in this case means supplies of medical goods food other essential items personnel 
2020-04-10 09:43:53+00:00, we need the rule of law not only in times of peace but most especially in times of great uncertainty at the level the intl health regulations provide a vital legal framework for bringing all who member states together to confront global health emergencies 
2020-04-10 09:43:16+00:00, the pandemic has placed new pressures and responsibilities on states on communities and on individuals the rule of law is what guarantees the functioning and stability of our countries which together make up the international community

2020-04-06 16:12:12+00:00, this would not have been possible without the incredible who have put themselves at risk for more than months to stop the outbreak in 
2020-04-06 16:11:27+00:00, we are nearing the end of the outbreak in if there are no more cases the govt of could declare the outbreak over as early as this sunday we re not there yet amp we remain on full response mode we re continuing to investigate alerts amp to test samples 
2020-04-06 16:10:23+00:00, i call on all countries companies and research institutions to support open data open science and open collaboration so that all people can enjoy the benefits of science and research 
2020-04-06 16:09:58+00:00, i support this proposal and we are working with to finalize the details poorer countries amp fragile economies stand to face the biggest shock from the pandemic amp leaving anyone unprotected will only prolong the health crisis amp harm economies more

2020-04-06 16:05:10+00:00, less than days since who was notified about the new research has accelerated at incredible speed the viral genome was mapped in early january and shared globally which enabled tests to be developed and vaccine research to start 
2020-04-06 16:04:46+00:00, mask or no mask there are proven things all of us can do to protect ourselves and others keep your distance clean your hands cough or sneeze into your elbow and avoid touching your face 
2020-04-06 16:04:30+00:00, there is no black or white answer and no silver bullet masks alone cannot stop the pandemic countries must continue to find test isolate and treat every case and trace every contact 
2020-04-06 16:03:57+00:00, we encourage countries that are considering the use of masks for the general population to study their effectiveness so we can all learn most importantly masks should only ever be used as part of a comprehensive package of interventions 
2020-04-06 16:03:40+00:00, if masks are worn they must be used safely and properly who has guidance on how to put on take off and dispose of masks what is clear is that there is limited research in this area 
2020-04-06 16:03:10+00:00, for example countries could consider using masks in communities where other measures such as cleaning hands and physical distancing are harder to achieve because of lack of water or cramped living conditions 
2020-04-06 16:02:50+00:00, who has been evaluating the use of medical and non medical masks for more widely today who is issuing guidance and criteria to support countries in making that decision 
2020-04-06 16:02:26+00:00, in the community we recommend the use of medical masks by people who are sick those who are caring for a sick person at home 
2020-04-06 16:02:26+00:00, in health care facilities who continues to recommend the use of medical masks respirators other personal protective equipment for 
2020-04-06 16:01:36+00:00, we are concerned that the mass use of medical masks by the general population could exacerbate the shortage of these specialized masks for the people who need them most in some places these shortages are putting in real danger 
2020-04-06 16:01:26+00:00, first and foremost medical masks must be prioritized for on the front lines of the response we know medical masks can help to protect health workers but they re in short supply globally 
2020-04-06 16:01:13+00:00, we understand that some countries have recommended or are considering the use of both medical and non medical masks in the general population to prevent the spread of

2020-04-03 16:31:00+00:00, make a plan to protect yourself your children any way you can this could include having a neighbour friend relative or shelter identified to go to should you need to leave the house immediately 
2020-04-03 16:30:32+00:00, if you are experiencing or at risk of domestic violence speak to supportive family friends seek support from a hotline or seek out local services for survivors 
2020-04-03 16:30:03+00:00, women may have less contact with family friends who may provide support protection from violence we call on countries to include services for addressing domestic violence as an essential service that must continue during the response 
2020-04-03 16:29:29+00:00, women in abusive relationships are more likely to be exposed to violence as are their children as family members spend more time in close contact and families cope with additional stress and potential economic or job losses 
2020-04-03 16:28:51+00:00, sadly there are reports from some countries of an increase in domestic violence since the outbreak began as people are asked to the risk of intimate partner violence is likely to increase

2020-03-25 17:58:57+00:00, together with our partners in the today weve launched the global humanitarian appeal to support the most fragile countries who have already suffered years of acute humanitarian crises 
2020-03-25 17:58:29+00:00, this is especially relevant for many vulnerable countries whose health systems may collapse under the weight of the numbers of patients weve seen in some countries with community transmission 
2020-03-25 17:58:06+00:00, more than countries territories still have fewer than cases by taking the same aggressive actions now these countries have the chance to prevent community transmission avoid some of the more severe social economic costs seen in other countries

2020-03-25 17:53:55+00:00, asking people to stay at home and shutting down population movement is buying time and reducing the pressure on health systems but on their own these measures will not extinguish epidemics 
2020-03-25 17:53:27+00:00, we understand that these countries are now trying to assess when and how they will be able to ease these measures the answer depends on what countries do while these population wide measures are in place 
2020-03-25 17:53:09+00:00, to slow the spread of many countries have introduced unprecedented measures at significant social and economic cost closing schools and businesses cancelling sporting events and asking people to stay home and stay safe 
2020-03-25 17:52:40+00:00, already we have lost more than lives we know we will lose more how many more will be determined by the decisions we make and the actions we take

2020-03-18 16:25:37+00:00, multiple small trials with different methods may not give us the clear strong evidence we need about which treatments help to save lives who partners are organizing a study in many countries in which some of these untested treatments are compared with each other 
2020-03-18 16:25:16+00:00, the first vaccine trial has begun just days after the genetic sequence of the was shared this is an incredible achievement we commend the researchers around the world who have come together to systemically evaluate experimental therapeutics 
2020-03-18 16:25:05+00:00, who continues to call on all countries to implement a comprehensive approach with the aim of slowing down transmission and flattening the curve this approach is saving lives and buying time for the development of vaccines and treatments 
2020-03-18 16:24:46+00:00, if health facilities are at risk of being overwhelmed people with mild disease can be cared for at home although this is not the ideal situation who has advice on our website for how home care can be provided as safely as possible 
2020-03-18 16:24:33+00:00, if that s not possible countries can use community facilities to isolate care for mild cases amp refer them for specialized care quickly if needed

2020-03-16 16:02:05+00:00, washing your hands will help to reduce your risk of infection but it s also an act of solidarity because it reduces the risk you will infect others in your community and around the world do it for yourself do it for others 
2020-03-16 16:01:16+00:00, as the moves to low income countries were deeply concerned about the impact it could have among populations with high hiv prevalence or malnourished children we re calling on every country amp individual to do everything they can to stop transmission 
2020-03-16 16:00:51+00:00, who has issued new clinical guidance with specific details on how to care for children older people and pregnant women so far we have seen epidemics in countries with advanced health systems but even they have struggled to cope 
2020-03-16 16:00:30+00:00, once again our key message is test test test this is a serious disease although the evidence we have suggests that those over are at highest risk young people including children have died 
2020-03-16 16:00:07+00:00, people infected with can still infect others after they stop feeling sick so these measures should continue for at least weeks after symptoms disappear visitors should not be allowed until the end of this period there are more details in who s guidance 
2020-03-16 15:59:41+00:00, assign one person to care for the patient ideally someone who is in good health and has no underlying conditions the care giver should wash their hands after any contact with the patient or their immediate environment 
2020-03-16 15:59:21+00:00, for example both the patient amp their care giver should wear a medical mask when they are together in the same room the patient should sleep in a separate bedroom to others and use a different bathroom 
2020-03-16 15:59:04+00:00, another option is for patients with mild to be isolated amp cared for at home caring for infected people at home may put others in the same household at risk so it s critical that care givers follow who s guidance on how to provide care as safely as possible 
2020-03-16 15:58:41+00:00, in that situation countries should prioritize older patients those with underlying conditions some countries have expanded their capacity by using stadiums gyms to care for mild cases with severe amp critical cases cared for in hospitals 
2020-03-16 15:58:18+00:00, who advises that all confirmed cases even mild cases should be isolated in health facilities to prevent transmission amp provide adequate care but we recognize that many countries have already exceeded their capacity to care for mild cases in dedicated 
2020-03-16 15:57:52+00:00, every day more tests are being produced to meet the global demand who has shipped almost million tests to countries we re working with companies to increase the availability of tests for those most in need 
2020-03-16 15:57:30+00:00, we have a simple message for all countries test test test test every suspected case if they test positive isolate them amp find out who they have been in close contact with up to days before they developed symptoms amp test those people too 
2020-03-16 15:57:02+00:00, but the most effective way to prevent infections save lives is breaking the chains of transmission to do that you must test amp isolate you cannot fight a fire blindfolded and we cannot stop this pandemic if we don t know who is infected 
2020-03-16 15:56:38+00:00, but on their own they arent enough to extinguish this pandemic it s the combination that makes the difference as i keep saying all countries must take a comprehensive approach 
2020-03-16 15:56:22+00:00, social distancing measures can help to reduce transmission and enable health systems to cope handwashing and coughing into your elbow can reduce the risk for yourself and others 
2020-03-16 15:56:05+00:00, we have seen a rapid escalation in social distancing measures like closing schools cancelling sporting events other gatherings but we havent seen an urgent enough escalation in testing isolation contact tracing which is the backbone of the response

2020-03-11 16:36:18+00:00, i remind all countries that we are calling on you to ready your hospitals protect and train your let s all look out for each other 
2020-03-11 16:36:18+00:00, i remind all countries that we are calling on you to activate scale up your emergency response mechanisms communicate with your people about the risks how they can protect themselves find isolate test treat every case amp trace every contact 
2020-03-11 16:34:16+00:00, let me summarize it in key areas prepare and be ready detect protect and treat reduce transmission innovate and learn 
2020-03-11 16:33:03+00:00, i have said from the beginning that countries must take a whole of government whole of society approach built around a comprehensive strategy to prevent infections save lives and minimize impact 
2020-03-11 16:32:43+00:00, this is not just a public health crisis it is a crisis that will touch every sector so every sector and every individual must be involved in the fight 
2020-03-11 16:32:19+00:00, who s mandate is public health but we re working with many partners across all sectors to mitigate the social and economic consequences of this pandemic 
2020-03-11 16:32:19+00:00, all countries must strike a fine balance between protecting health minimizing economic social disruption respecting human rights 
2020-03-11 16:31:22+00:00, we are grateful for the measures being taken in and to slow the virus and control their epidemics we know that these measures are taking a heavy toll on societies and economies just as they did in 
2020-03-11 16:30:31+00:00, some countries are struggling with a lack of capacity some countries are struggling with a lack of resources some countries are struggling with a lack of resolve 
2020-03-11 16:30:17+00:00, the challenge for many countries who are now dealing with large clusters or community transmission is not whether they can do the same it s whether they will 
2020-03-11 16:30:03+00:00, even those countries with community transmission or large clusters can turn the tide on this several countries have demonstrated that this virus can be suppressed and controlled 
2020-03-11 16:29:47+00:00, if countries detect test treat isolate trace and mobilize their people in the response those with a handful of cases can prevent those cases becoming clusters and those clusters becoming community transmission 
2020-03-11 16:29:20+00:00, countries have not reported any cases and countries have reported cases or less we cannot say this loudly enough or clearly enough or often enough all countries can still change the course of this pandemic 
2020-03-11 16:28:49+00:00, of the cases reported globally in countries more than percent of cases are in just four countries and two of those and have significantly declining epidemics 
2020-03-11 16:28:26+00:00, as i said on monday just looking at the number of cases and the number of countries affected does not tell the full story 
2020-03-11 16:28:10+00:00, we have called every day for countries to take urgent and aggressive action we have rung the alarm bell loud and clear 
2020-03-11 16:28:00+00:00, we have never before seen a pandemic sparked by a and we have never before seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time who has been in full response mode since we were notified of the first cases 
2020-03-11 16:27:30+00:00, describing the situation as a pandemic does not change who s assessment of the threat posed by this it doesn t change what who is doing and it doesn t change what countries should do 
2020-03-11 16:27:19+00:00, pandemic is not a word to use lightly or carelessly it is a word that if misused can cause unreasonable fear or unjustified acceptance that the fight is over leading to unnecessary suffering and death 
2020-03-11 16:26:53+00:00, breaking we have therefore made the assessment that can be characterized as a pandemic 
2020-03-11 16:26:40+00:00, who has been assessing this outbreak around the clock and we are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity and by the alarming levels of inaction 
2020-03-11 16:26:21+00:00, thousands more are fighting for their lives in hospitals in the days and weeks ahead we expect to see the number of cases the number of deaths and the number of affected countries climb even higher 
2020-03-11 16:25:58+00:00, in the past two weeks the number of cases of outside has increased fold amp the number of affected countries has tripled there are now more than cases in countries amp people have lost their lives

2020-03-09 17:29:44+00:00,here are some photos from todays media briefing on 
2020-03-09 16:29:14+00:00, let hope be the antidote to fear let solidarity be the antidote to blame let our shared humanity be the antidote to our shared threat 
2020-03-09 16:28:53+00:00, we re encouraged that is taking aggressive measures to contain its epidemic and we hope that those measures prove effective in the coming days 
2020-03-09 16:28:18+00:00, the rule of the game is never give up but that can only be achieved with aggressive action as early as possible half hearted measures will leave the door ajar for the 
2020-03-09 16:27:49+00:00, of the countries with the most cases is bringing its epidemic under control amp there is now a decline in new cases being reported from both these countries demonstrate that it s never too late to turn back the tide on this 
2020-03-09 16:26:58+00:00, as long as that s the case those countries have the opportunity to break the chains of transmission prevent community transmission and reduce the burden on their health systems 
2020-03-09 16:26:29+00:00, for the moment only a handful of countries have signs of sustained community transmission most countries still have sporadic cases or defined clusters we must all take heart from that 
2020-03-09 16:25:57+00:00, almost usd million has now been pledged to who s strategic preparedness response plan we are encouraged by these signs of global solidarity we continue to call on all countries to take early aggressive action to protect their people save lives 
2020-03-09 16:25:00+00:00, more funds are being made available for the response and we re very grateful to all countries amp partners who have contributed just since friday amp have announced contributions 
2020-03-09 16:23:46+00:00, we re also working with our colleagues across the system to support countries to develop their preparedness amp response plans according to the pillars we have set up a partners platform to match country needs with contributions from donors 
2020-03-09 16:23:20+00:00, we ve shipped supplies of personal protective equipment to countries we re preparing to ship to a further and we ve shipped lab supplies to countries 
2020-03-09 16:23:07+00:00, further details on specific actions countries should take in specific contexts are available on who s website who is continuing to support countries in all four scenarios 
2020-03-09 16:22:43+00:00, nigeria senegal and ethiopia have strengthened surveillance and diagnostic capacity to find cases quickly 
2020-03-09 16:22:28+00:00, have increased efforts to identify all cases and contacts including drive through temperature testing to widen the net and catch cases that might otherwise be missed 
2020-03-09 16:22:08+00:00, is a good example of an all of government approach prime minister s regular videos are helping to explain the risks amp reassure people 
2020-03-09 16:21:52+00:00, there are many examples of countries demonstrating that these measures work amp many others have activated emergency measures 
2020-03-09 16:21:33+00:00, the fundamental elements of the response are the same for all countries laboratory testing treating patients amp hospital readiness infection prevention amp control all of society amp all of government approach 
2020-03-09 16:21:33+00:00, the fundamental elements of the response are the same for all countries emergency response mechanisms risk comms amp public engagement case finding amp contact tracing public health measures 
2020-03-09 16:20:49+00:00, depending on their context countries with community transmission could consider closing schools cancelling mass gatherings and other measures to reduce exposure 
2020-03-09 16:20:33+00:00, in areas with community spread testing every suspected case and tracing their contacts becomes more challenging action must be taken to prevent transmission at the community level to reduce the epidemic to manageable clusters 
2020-03-09 16:20:11+00:00, for the first three categories countries must focus on finding testing treating and isolating individual cases and following their contacts 
2020-03-09 16:19:55+00:00, who has consolidated our guidance for countries in categories with no cases with sporadic cases with clusters with community transmission for all countries the aim is the same stop transmission amp prevent the spread of the 
2020-03-09 16:19:25+00:00, countries that continue finding and testing cases and tracing their contacts not only protect their own people they can also affect what happens in other countries and globally 
2020-03-09 16:19:13+00:00, all countries must take a comprehensive blended strategy for controlling their epidemics amp pushing this back 
2020-03-09 16:18:52+00:00, this is an uneven epidemic at the global level different countries are in different scenarios requiring a tailored response it s not about containment or mitigation which is a false dichotomy it s about both 
2020-03-09 16:18:29+00:00, it s also important to remember that looking only at the total number of reported cases amp the total number of countries doesn t tell the full story of all the cases reported globally so far are from just four countries 
2020-03-09 16:18:06+00:00, we need to remember that with decisive early action we can slow down the and prevent infections among those who are infected most will recover of the reported cases in more than have recovered and been discharged 
2020-03-09 16:17:18+00:00, now that the has a foothold in so many countries the threat of a pandemic has become very real but it would be the first pandemic in history that could be controlled the bottom line is we are not at the mercy of this virus 
2020-03-09 16:16:51+00:00, over the weekend we crossed reported cases of in countries it s certainly troubling that so many people amp countries have been affected so quickly 
2020-03-09 16:16:31+00:00, the outbreak in may be ending but our determination is not and nor is our commitment to combating the epidemic 
2020-03-09 16:16:09+00:00, we continue to investigate alerts vaccinate contacts every day the security situation in remains fragile in previous outbreaks we have seen flare ups even after the end of the outbreak so we are continuing to provide follow up care for over survivors 
2020-03-09 16:15:38+00:00, i d like to start with a brief update on the epidemic in it s now three weeks since the last case was reported and a week since the last survivor left the treatment centre we are now in the countdown to the end of the outbreak

2020-03-06 15:37:42+00:00, we re also developing research protocols to assess interventions for disenfranchised communities such as refugees internally displaced persons we re very encouraged by the level of interest around the world in accelerating research as part of the response 
2020-03-06 15:36:25+00:00, who has developed a set of core protocols that outline standards for how studies should be done to collect critical data so we can compare apples with apples pool data from multiple studies 
2020-03-06 15:34:45+00:00, it s vital to coordinate research so that different groups around the world complement each other so who can give better advice and countries can take evidence based decisions that save lives 
2020-03-06 15:34:12+00:00, these incl the natural history of the epidemiology vaccines diagnostics therapeutics clinical management ethical considerations social sciences the r amp d roadmap focuses on research that can save lives now as well as longer term research priorities 
2020-03-06 15:32:24+00:00, last month who convened a meeting of over scientists to identify research priorities hundreds of ideas were discussed amp debated amp today we are publishing an r amp d roadmap which distills those ideas into a core group of priorities in key areas 
2020-03-06 15:31:03+00:00, every day we slow down the epidemic is another day governments can prepare their to detect test treat amp care for patients closer to having vaccines amp therapeutics which can in turn prevent infections amp save lives 
2020-03-06 15:30:03+00:00, slowing down the epidemic saves lives and it buys time for preparedness and for research and development every day we can slow down the epidemic is another day hospitals can prepare themselves for cases 
2020-03-06 15:29:26+00:00, as cases increase we are continuing to recommend that all countries make containment their highest priority we continue to call on countries to find test isolate and care for every case and to trace every contact 
2020-03-06 15:28:58+00:00, in the past h cases of were reported from countries amp territories there is now a total of reported cases globally amp deaths we are now on the verge of reaching confirmed cases 
2020-03-06 15:28:12+00:00, women are also playing a vital role in the response to and we re proud to have many amazing women leading our response including ana maria mari ngela marie pierre adriana amp many others

2020-03-05 16:11:38+00:00, is a serious disease it is not deadly to most people but it can kill we re all responsible for reducing our own risk of infection and if we re infected for reducing our risk of infecting others 
2020-03-05 16:11:04+00:00, there s still a lot we don t know but every day we re learning more we re working around the clock to fill in the gaps in our knowledge ultimately how deadly this will be depends not only on the virus itself but on how we respond to it

2020-03-05 16:07:53+00:00, although presents an acute threat now it is absolutely essential that countries do not lose this opportunity to strengthen their preparedness systems 
2020-03-05 16:07:22+00:00, this is funding that is available now to countries who need it in line with who s strategic preparedness and response plan these funds are essential for supporting the response now but also for long term preparedness 
2020-03-05 16:06:41+00:00, the amp the international monetary fund have both made funds available to stabilize health systems amp mitigate the economic consequences of the epidemic with a special focus on enabling access to critical supplies and equipment 
2020-03-05 16:06:18+00:00, more funding is being made available to support countries that need it that have plans in place 
2020-03-05 16:05:14+00:00, who has published step by step guidelines for countries to develop their natl action plans according to key areas which are supported by detailed technical guidance we call on all countries to accelerate those plans stand ready to work with them to do that 
2020-03-05 16:04:21+00:00, if we take the approach that there s nothing we can do that will quickly become a self fulfilling prophecy it s in our hands 
2020-03-05 16:04:07+00:00, train your to identify cases provide careful amp compassionate treatment amp protect themselves from infection if countries act aggressively to find isolate treat cases amp trace every contact they can change the trajectory of this epidemic 
2020-03-05 16:03:19+00:00, activate your emergency plans educate your public so that people know what the symptoms are amp know how to protect themselves and others increase your testing capacity get your hospitals ready ensure essential supplies are available 
2020-03-05 16:02:32+00:00, these are plans that start with leadership from the top coordinating every part of government not just the health ministry security diplomacy finance commerce transport trade information and more 
2020-03-05 16:02:08+00:00, this is not a drill this is not the time to give up this is not a time for excuses this is a time for pulling out all the stops countries have been planning for scenarios like this for decades now is the time to act on those plans

2020-03-05 16:00:47+00:00, we are calling on every country to act with speed scale clear minded determination although we continue to see the majority of cases in a handful of countries we are deeply concerned about the increasing number of countries reporting cases 
2020-03-05 16:00:23+00:00, the experience of these countries of continues to demonstrate that this is not a one way street this epidemic can be pushed back but only with a collective coordinated amp comprehensive approach that engages the entire machinery of government 
2020-03-05 15:59:58+00:00, although a few countries are reporting large numbers of cases countries have not reported any cases countries have reported only one case countries that had reported cases have not reported new cases in the past days 
2020-03-05 15:59:34+00:00, we see encouraging signs from the number of newly reported cases appears to be declining amp the cases that are being reported are being identified primarily from known clusters 
2020-03-05 15:59:18+00:00, outside cases were reported in countries around of those cases continue to come from just three countries

2020-03-03 16:13:38+00:00, once again this is a question of solidarity this cannot be solved by who alone or one industry alone it requires all of us working together to ensure all countries can protect the people who protect the rest of us 
2020-03-03 16:13:16+00:00, we have called on governments to develop incentives for manufacturers to ramp up production this includes easing restrictions on the export distribution of personal protective equipment other medical supplies 
2020-03-03 16:12:46+00:00, we continue to call on manufacturers to urgently increase production to meet this demand guarantee supplies 
2020-03-03 16:12:09+00:00, we re working with governments manufacturers the pandemic supply chain network to boost production secure supplies for critically affected at risk countries it is estimated that personal protective equipment supplies need to be increased by

2020-03-03 16:07:16+00:00, because is also a respiratory pathogen those systems can should and are being adapted for covid 
2020-03-03 16:06:49+00:00, these differences mean we can t treat exactly the same way we treat flu but there are enough similarities to mean that countries are not starting from scratch for decades many countries have invested in building up their systems to detect amp respond to flu 
2020-03-03 16:05:22+00:00, fourth we don t even talk about containment for seasonal flu it s just not possible but it is possible for we don t bother with contact tracing for seasonal flu but countries should do it for covid because it will prevent infections amp save lives 
2020-03-03 16:04:54+00:00, third we have vaccines therapeutics for seasonal flu but at the moment there is no vaccine no specific treatment for however clinical trials of therapeutics are now being done amp more than vaccines are in development 
2020-03-03 16:04:23+00:00, globally about of reported cases have died by comparison seasonal flu generally kills far fewer than of those infected 
2020-03-03 16:04:00+00:00,the second major difference is that causes more severe disease than seasonal influenza while many people globally have built up immunity to seasonal flu strains covid is a new to which no one has immunity 
2020-03-03 16:03:31+00:00, who has developed protocols on how these studies should be done and we encourage all countries to do these studies and share their data 
2020-03-03 16:03:12+00:00, the only way to be sure is by looking for antibodies in large numbers of people and several countries are now doing those studies this will give us further insight into the extent of infection in populations over time 
2020-03-03 16:02:53+00:00, countries such as amp elsewhere have found very few cases of among such samples or no cases at all

2020-02-27 14:03:18+00:00, in guangdong scientists tested more than samples from the community and only were positive for that suggests that containment is possible indeed there are many countries that have done exactly that 
2020-02-27 14:02:52+00:00, but this is not influenza with the right measures it can be contained that is one of the key messages from the evidence we have is that there does not appear to be widespread community transmission 
2020-02-27 14:02:35+00:00, the epidemics in the islamic republic of iran italy and the republic of korea demonstrate what this is capable of

2020-02-25 07:07:36+00:00,stigma can drive people to hide the illness to avoid discrimination prevent people from seeking health care immediately discourage them from adopting healthy behaviours

2020-02-24 15:15:35+00:00, i wish to thank the for its contribution of million euros which demonstrates the kind of global solidarity that gives me hope 
2020-02-24 15:14:31+00:00, but there are at least priorities we must protect countries that are the most vulnerable by doing our utmost to contain epidemics in countries with the capacity to do it 
2020-02-24 15:14:05+00:00, but there are at least priorities all countries must prioritize protecting we must engage communities to protect people who are most at risk of severe disease particularly the elderly and people with underlying health conditions 
2020-02-24 15:12:06+00:00, there is no one size fits all approach every country must make its own risk assessment for its own context 
2020-02-24 15:11:30+00:00, using the word pandemic now does not fit the facts but it may certainly cause fear we do not live in a binary black and white world it s not either or we must focus on containment while doing everything we can to prepare for a potential pandemic 
2020-02-24 15:11:19+00:00, what we see are epidemics in different parts of the world affecting countries in different ways requiring a tailored response the sudden increase in new cases is certainly very concerning i have spoken consistently about the need for facts not fear 
2020-02-24 15:11:03+00:00, for the moment we are not witnessing the uncontained global spread of this and we are not witnessing large scale severe disease or death does this virus have pandemic potential absolutely are we there yet from our assessment not yet 
2020-02-24 15:10:10+00:00, our decision about whether to use the word pandemic to describe an epidemic is based on an ongoing assessment of the geographical spread of the virus the severity of disease it causes and the impact it has on the whole of society 
2020-02-24 15:09:49+00:00, there s a lot of speculation about whether these increases mean that this epidemic has now become a pandemic who has already declared a pheic our highest level of alarm when there were less than cases outside amp cases of human to human transmission 
2020-02-24 15:09:16+00:00, outside there are now cases in countries amp deaths the sudden increases of cases in italy the islamic republic of iran amp the republic of korea are deeply concerning 
2020-02-24 15:08:51+00:00, dr bruce aylward will give more detail tomorrow on behalf of the joint team but the key message that should give all countries hope courage and confidence is that this can be contained 
2020-02-24 15:08:33+00:00, the team also estimate that the measures taken in have averted a significant number of cases the report contains a wealth of other information highlights questions for which we still don t have answers amp includes recommendations 
2020-02-24 15:08:17+00:00, they found that the fatality rate is between in wuhan amp outside wuhan they found that for people with mild disease recovery time is about two weeks while people with severe or critical disease recover within three to six weeks 
2020-02-24 15:07:46+00:00, they found that the epidemic peaked amp plateaued between the rd of january amp the nd of february amp has been declining steadily since then they have found that there has been no significant change in the dna of the

2020-02-22 07:06:30+00:00, i assure you that who is committed to working with all african countries to do everything we can to prevent transmission and detect and treat cases as early as possible 
2020-02-22 07:05:55+00:00, the increasing signs of transmission outside show that the window of opportunity we have for containing this is narrowing we are calling on all countries to invest urgently in preparedness 
2020-02-22 07:05:27+00:00, we have also held two calls with resident coordinators all over the world to brief them on the actions they can take to prepare their countries and ensure the united nations system is working as one 
2020-02-22 07:05:11+00:00, weeks ago i briefed sg amp we agreed to activate the un crisis management team led by to enable who to focus on the health response while other agencies bring their expertise to bear on the other implications of the outbreak 
2020-02-22 07:04:43+00:00, we re also providing advice to countries on how to do screening testing contact tracing treatment last week we brought the intl research community together to identify research priorities especially in the areas of diagnostics therapeutics vaccines 
2020-02-22 07:04:15+00:00, during the past month about african have been trained using who s online courses on which are available free of charge in english french amp other languages at 
2020-02-22 07:04:00+00:00, we re working with manufacturers of personal protective equipment ppe to address the severe disruption in the market for masks gloves gowns and other ppe to ensure we can protect 
2020-02-22 07:03:44+00:00, we ve also shipped more than sets of personal protective equipment to six countries in africa and we re ready to ship almost more sets to countries in the coming weeks 
2020-02-22 07:03:29+00:00, some countries in africa including are also leveraging the capacity they have built up to test for to test for this is a great example of how investing in health systems can pay dividends for health security 
2020-02-22 07:03:10+00:00, increasing number of african countries are now able to test for with laboratory test kits supplied by who compared with only two labs just a couple of weeks ago 
2020-02-22 07:02:51+00:00, we ve published a strategic preparedness response plan with a call for us m to support countries especially the most vulnerable who has identified priority countries in africa because of their direct links to or the high volume of travel with 
2020-02-22 07:02:26+00:00, we have just appointed dr director amp prof samba sow director general of the center for vaccine development in as special envoys on to provide strategic advice and high level political advocacy amp engagement in africa 
2020-02-22 07:02:15+00:00, our biggest concern continues to be the potential for to spread in countries with weaker health systems in partnership with the we re working hard to prepare countries in africa for the potential arrival of the virus 
2020-02-22 07:01:34+00:00, in of reported cases the is fatal and the risk of death increases the older a patient is and with underlying health conditions we see relatively few cases among children more research is needed to understand why 
2020-02-22 07:01:08+00:00, of patients have severe or critical ranging from shortness of breath to septic shock amp multi organ failure these patients require intensive care using equipment such as respiratory support machines that are in short supply in many african countries 
2020-02-22 07:00:45+00:00, with every day that passes we know a little bit more about this amp the disease it causes we know that more than of patients have mild disease amp will recover 
2020-02-22 07:00:30+00:00, as you know a who led international team of experts including a representative from the has been on the ground in for the past week 
2020-02-22 06:59:32+00:00, we are especially concerned about the increase in cases in the islamic republic of where there are now cases amp deaths in just the past two days who has supplied testing kits to amp we will continue to provide further support in the coming days amp weeks 
2020-02-22 06:59:09+00:00, although the total number of cases outside remains relatively small we are concerned about the number of cases with no clear epidemiological link such as travel history to or contact with a confirmed case 
2020-02-22 06:58:52+00:00, outside there are now cases in countries with deaths as you know there is one confirmed case on the african continent in several african countries have tested suspected cases of but fortunately they have been found negative 
2020-02-22 06:58:25+00:00, has now reported cases to who including deaths the data from continue to show a decline in new cases this is welcome news but it must be interpreted very cautiously it s far too early to make predictions about this outbreak 
2020-02-22 06:57:42+00:00, as you know who declared a public health emergency of international concern less than a month after the first reported cases as a result of the signs of human to human transmission we saw outside 
2020-02-22 06:57:27+00:00, in just weeks the outbreak has captured the s attention and rightly so because it has the potential to cause severe political social amp economic upheaval 
2020-02-22 06:57:11+00:00, it s hard to believe that only days ago who s country office in was notified of a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause in wuhan city 
2020-02-22 06:56:06+00:00,live now briefing on

2020-02-21 16:06:18+00:00,we can through universal health coverage its time for 
2020-02-21 15:22:55+00:00, we must not look back and regret that we failed to take advantage of the window of opportunity we have 
2020-02-21 15:22:35+00:00, the measures amp other countries have taken have given us a fighting chance of containing the spread of the we call on all countries to continue their containment measures while preparing for community transmission if it occurs 
2020-02-21 15:21:51+00:00, as i said yesterday who s key role is coordinating the global response to the epidemic our new special envoys will help us to do that this is another step we are taking to take advantage of the window of opportunity we have to contain the outbreak 
2020-02-21 15:21:10+00:00, dr director dr mirta roses former director dr shin young soo former director prof samba o sow director general center for vaccine development in

2020-02-21 15:16:00+00:00, i m also pleased to announce that today we are appointing four special envoys on to provide strategic advice and high level political advocacy and engagement in different parts of the world 
2020-02-21 15:15:28+00:00, we are working with all of partners under the goarn network to safeguard the health of the members of the team and to take appropriate measures when they return to their countries of origin 
2020-02-21 15:15:12+00:00, meanwhile the who led joint mission in has been working in beijing sichuan and guangdong and will travel to wuhan tomorrow to continue its work at the epicenter of the outbreak 
2020-02-21 15:14:41+00:00, our concern continues to be the potential for to spread in countries with weaker health systems tomorrow i will address an emergency meeting of african health ministers held jointly by the african union and the 
2020-02-21 15:13:10+00:00, we are also concerned about the increase in cases in the islamic republic of where there are now cases and four deaths who has supplied testing kits and will continue to provide further support 
2020-02-21 15:12:40+00:00, apart from the cruise ship the republic of now has the most cases outside and we re working closely with the government to fully understand the transmission dynamics that led to this increase 
2020-02-21 15:12:06+00:00, outside there are now cases in countries amp deaths 
2020-02-21 15:10:58+00:00, although the number of cases in hubei province continues declining we are concerned about an increase in the number of cases in shandong province and we are seeking more information about that 
2020-02-21 15:10:31+00:00, this may indicate because the health system in wuhan have regained the ability to test all suspected cases as a result some cases that had been clinically confirmed have now been subtracted from the total because they have tested negative 
2020-02-21 15:10:04+00:00, the significant in confirmed cases is partly due to another change in the way reports numbers last week started reporting clinically diagnosed cases in addition to lab confirmed cases they have now switched back to reporting suspected amp lab confirmed cases 
2020-02-21 15:09:34+00:00, as of am gva time this morning has reported a total of cases of to who including deaths in the past hours has reported new confirmed cases and deaths

2020-02-20 20:33:02+00:00, seat belts helmets child seats low speed lower alcohol limits for young drivers sidewalks and bike lanes they all reduce the risk of deaths on the road 
2020-02-20 16:58:03+00:00,more people die every year as a result of road traffic injury than from hiv aids tuberculosis and diarrhoeal diseases but the political commitment investments in is only a small fraction of that made to combat these diseases

2020-02-15 14:04:34+00:00, health security is therefore not just the health sector s business it s everybody s business at 
2020-02-15 14:04:13+00:00, without peace health can be an unattainable dream but the opposite can also be true epidemics have the potential to cause severe political economic social instability insecurity at 
2020-02-15 14:03:57+00:00, it was no coincidence the pandemic erupted in the middle of the ww i the final frontier for eradicating is in the most insecure regions of amp has spread in the most insecure region of drc 
2020-02-15 14:03:39+00:00, this experience illustrates a key lesson of history disease and insecurity are old friends at 
2020-02-15 14:03:15+00:00, this epidemic stands in stark contrast to the previous outbreak in the western part of drc in an area that is relatively stable and peaceful that outbreak was controlled in just three months at

2020-02-15 09:53:11+00:00,most childhood can be cured with generic medicines and other forms of treatments including surgery and radiotherapy 
2020-02-15 08:39:11+00:00,the most common categories of childhood include leukemias brain cancers lymphomas solid tumours such as neuroblastoma and wilms tumour 
2020-02-15 07:51:41+00:00, is a leading cause of death for children and adolescents around the approximately children aged to years old are diagnosed with cancer each year 
2020-02-14 17:10:29+00:00, when used correctly and consistently are safe and highly effective in preventing unwanted pregnancy preventing sexually transmitted infections including hiv 
2020-02-14 17:07:31+00:00,if a breaks seek advice from your health care worker as soon as possible ask about emergency contraception hiv prevention and sexually transmitted infections testing 
2020-02-14 15:41:56+00:00,the full briefing by on 
2020-02-14 15:30:32+00:00, lastly i want to say again from my heart that this is the time for solidarity not stigma there are worrying signs that the world is not hearing the call for unity standing in unison with those at the epicenter in who are saving lives amp alleviating suffering 
2020-02-14 15:29:49+00:00, today hundreds of passengers are disembarking and are en route to their home countries passengers who reported signs of illness have tested negative for the virus i hope that other countries will follow s lead from 
2020-02-14 15:28:51+00:00, i wish to thank for demonstrating to the world the meaning of solidarity while other countries turned away the cruise ship allowed it to dock from 
2020-02-14 15:27:46+00:00, we re working with our chinese counterparts on these issues and this is also part of the scope of work for the who led joint mission with from 
2020-02-14 15:27:20+00:00, clearly this is an evolving picture amp responders in are working with virtually no sleep in difficult conditions but we need to ensure that we re getting the most accurate data as quickly as possible to assist amp support the global response 
2020-02-14 15:26:42+00:00, it will be important to review which type of information is needed so that the world can use this window of opportunity to prepare health systems and workers for possible outbreaks from 
2020-02-14 15:26:14+00:00, particular attention will be paid to understanding the transmission of the virus the severity of disease the impact of ongoing response measures from 
2020-02-14 15:26:14+00:00, the goal of the joint mission is to rapidly inform the next steps in the response amp preparedness activities in amp globally from 
2020-02-14 15:25:19+00:00, the joint mission will include in depth workshops a data review with the principal ministries meetings with key national level institutions field visits in three provinces to understand the application impact of response activities at provincial county levels 
2020-02-14 15:24:13+00:00, i m glad to say that the who led joint mission with on is moving forward we expect the full team to touch down over the weekend the mission consists of international amp who experts amp a similar number of national expert counterparts from 
2020-02-14 15:23:04+00:00, we have been in regular contact with suppliers asking them to prioritize production and distribution of personal protective equipment to on the front lines we are also in touch with member states on this important issue 
2020-02-14 15:22:33+00:00, who guidelines have been developed for taking care of hospitalised adults and paediatric patients with acute infections these guidelines have been made available to all countries 
2020-02-14 15:22:08+00:00, this is a critical piece of information because are the glue that holds the health system amp outbreak response together we need to know more about this figure including the time period amp circumstances in which the health workers became sick 
2020-02-14 15:21:10+00:00, the vice minister of the national health commission has said that as of tuesday have been infected and six have died from 
2020-02-14 15:20:41+00:00,correction in total there have been deaths in including reported today outside china there have been cases in countries and two deaths from 
2020-02-14 15:14:23+00:00, in total there have been deaths in including reported today outside china there have been cases in countries and two deaths from 
2020-02-14 15:13:08+00:00, we are seeking further clarity on how clinical diagnosis is being made to ensure other respiratory illnesses including influenza are not getting mixed into the data from 
2020-02-14 15:12:21+00:00, as you know has changed the way it reports data from hubei province there are now a total of laboratory confirmed cases in china and cases that have been clinically confirmed in hubei province from 
2020-02-14 15:11:44+00:00, i am glad to say that countries around the world are in a better state of preparedness for than they were just a week ago and who s efforts to help countries boost their lab capacity continue from 
2020-02-14 15:11:15+00:00, whether it s or investing in preparedness is the smartest way to ensure disease outbreaks are identified and stopped quickly from 
2020-02-14 15:10:51+00:00, but it is also vitally important that resources and attention focus on strengthening the country s health system and bolstering preparedness from 
2020-02-14 15:10:37+00:00, i have been impressed with the commitment of amp his government to ending the outbreak in eastern and i would like to urge the whole world to recommit to getting to zero ebola cases 
2020-02-14 15:09:55+00:00, i am speaking to you from where i have met with ministers colleagues amp partners to review the impressive progress that has been made to end amp to talk about future plans to ensure that everyone in can access quality health services 
2020-02-14 14:22:31+00:00, can be difficult for some people reach out to people you care about who may be feeling lonely and check if they are ok 
2020-02-14 13:52:26+00:00,who has formally requested additional information on the clinically diagnosed cases in particular when these have occurred in the course of the outbreak and whether suspect cases were reclassified as clinically diagnosed cases 
2020-02-14 13:15:06+00:00,this single take time for yourself get in touch with friends do something thats good for your health
2020-02-14 12:17:12+00:00,for consistency we report in the who situation report only the number of laboratory confirmed cases 
2020-02-14 11:59:19+00:00,doctors nurses and midwives do not be the source of stigma treat sexually transmitted infections just like you would any other infection 
2020-02-14 11:49:34+00:00,on thursday cases including clinically diagnosed cases were reported from hubei this is the first time has reported clinically diagnosed cases in addition to laboratory confirmed cases 
2020-02-14 11:41:03+00:00,if you have a sexually transmitted infection or you think you have an infection do not be ashamed go to your doctor make sure you do not transmit the infection to others 
2020-02-14 11:10:28+00:00,dyk more than million sexually transmitted infections are acquired every day worldwide this be safe 
2020-02-14 10:34:44+00:00,this if you choose to have sex be responsible be safe have fun use a correctly
2020-02-14 10:00:32+00:00,this if you are thinking about having sex have in mind you should feel comfortable with your decision talk to your partner about safe sex practices you have control over your own body and no one else has the right to tell you what to do with it
2020-02-14 09:46:39+00:00, rest assured the who and all our partners in the international community will be with you every step of the way as we strive to promote health keep the world safe serve the vulnerable in 
2020-02-14 09:45:34+00:00, this positive and powerful shift can increase the health system s capacity to prepare for and respond to any health emergency in line with the newly validated national action plan for health security in 
2020-02-14 09:44:56+00:00, the transition from to universal health coverage provides a unique opportunity to strengthen the entire health system as long as the political commitment translates into the adequate amp progressive mobilization of domestic resources 
2020-02-14 09:43:26+00:00, to strengthen the health in all policies approach to reduce the burden of disease ensure the sustainability of the system to foster good governance management of the national system to mobilize the resources needed to implement in 
2020-02-14 09:43:26+00:00, who stands ready to support in implementing the strategic universal health coverage plan and achieving its main objectives to improve health service delivery across all levels of the health system to provide financial protection to all people 
2020-02-14 09:40:39+00:00, but achieving universal health coverage is first and foremost a political choice that is the choice we are seeing here today in 
2020-02-14 09:40:38+00:00, it also means access to skilled amp safe effective amp affordable medicines sustained investment to build amp equip hospitals clinics and laboratories in 
2020-02-14 09:38:53+00:00, most importantly that means building a strong system that can reach all communities with services to promote health prevent disease and provide treatment in 
2020-02-14 09:38:01+00:00, ultimately the best defense against any outbreak is a strong health system that is why we re here we must work together to strengthen the health system of to promote amp protect the people of this great country because that is what they deserve 
2020-02-14 09:37:03+00:00, much of our effort has been focused in the african continent as we bolster health systems to be able to respond if needed while laying the groundwork where needed for stronger emergency preparedness in 
2020-02-14 09:36:16+00:00, therefore we are focusing our efforts on strengthening diagnostic capacities delivering supplies like masks gloves and aprons to protect who care for people who have contracted the in 
2020-02-14 09:35:02+00:00, we are most concerned about communities and countries that have weaker health systems which in turn may be more vulnerable to the import of the in 
2020-02-14 09:32:54+00:00, like with in eastern our strategy is to hammer at its epicenter in where of all cases have been reported 
2020-02-14 09:30:18+00:00, and we must also prepare for other crises such as the current outbreak of 
2020-02-14 09:29:39+00:00, this is why his excellency president tshisekedi and his government are taking the steps needed to plan for a beyond but even as we continue to work to end this outbreak we must act now to ensure there is never another one like it 
2020-02-14 09:27:59+00:00, earlier this week the emergency committee on advised me that in their view the outbreak remains a public health emergency of international concern i accepted that advice 
2020-02-14 09:27:24+00:00, hope is in sight we are nearing the end of the outbreak just four cases were reported last week compared with during one week in april last year but as long as there is a single case in circulation the outbreak has not been defeated 
2020-02-14 09:26:13+00:00, the who and the wider international community have stood shoulder to shoulder with we have joined you in a campaign to strangle the virus at its source and contain its spread 
2020-02-14 09:26:12+00:00, the government has faced this battle head on led by the who has himself travelled to affected communities to lead what has become a monumental response 
2020-02-14 09:23:52+00:00, since the outbreak began in august more than people have contracted the virus and more than have lost their lives 
2020-02-14 09:22:56+00:00, your country s people have faced many health challenges from malaria to measles with one of the most devastating outbreak in the past years to malnutrition and 
2020-02-14 09:21:37+00:00, i was honoured that president tshisekedi stood up among other heads of state to voice his strong support and commitment for universal health covearage his vision and enthusiasm for change are why we are here today 
2020-02-14 09:20:22+00:00, our road continued to new york last september during the when world leaders adopted the first political declaration on universal health coverage 
2020-02-14 09:19:30+00:00, many of you might not know that the path we are taking today started in july when the president told me during a meeting in abuja about his determination to ensure universal health coverage in 
2020-02-14 09:18:27+00:00, today s kinshasa commitment on universal health coverage the presentation of the national strategy represent profound and practical steps towards achieving president tshisekedi amp who have walked a long road together for promoting amp protecting health 
2020-02-14 07:31:37+00:00,this going for a first date be kind be respectful have fun moderate your alcohol consumption if you choose to have sex be safe
2020-02-14 06:51:17+00:00,its be healthy together cook a healthy meal do physical activities together avoid harmful use of alcohol practice safe sex
2020-02-13 18:09:59+00:00,avoid using that are expired see manufacturing or expiry date on the package do not use a latex condom more than years old it s expired and may break during use 
2020-02-13 17:38:49+00:00,the full briefing on by today 
2020-02-13 16:36:42+00:00,male and female cannot get lodged inside the uterus nor do they have any harmful effects on a foetus if the woman is pregnant the opening to the cervix is far too small to allow a condom to pass through 
2020-02-13 16:10:50+00:00,sexual stimulation can be enhanced when a man allows their partner to put the on him prior to sexual intercourse 
2020-02-13 15:44:39+00:00, in terms of the international mission the advanced team and their chinese counterparts have now finalized the scope of work and design of the mission we expect the rest of the international team to start arriving in over the weekend 
2020-02-13 15:43:57+00:00, outside there are cases from other countries and two deaths in addition to the death in the philippines there is now one more death of the world in japan 
2020-02-13 15:42:05+00:00, we have seen a significant spike in the number of reported cases in but not a significant change in the trajectory of the outbreak 
2020-02-13 15:41:23+00:00, in the rest of and the rest of the world laboratory confirmation is still required who will continue to track both laboratory and clinically confirmed cases in hubei province 
2020-02-13 15:40:19+00:00, in other words in hubei province only a trained medical professional can now classify a suspected case of as a clinically confirmed case on the basis of chest imaging rather than a laboratory confirmation 
2020-02-13 15:39:53+00:00, this increase is in large part down to a change in how cases are diagnosed and reported 
2020-02-13 15:39:29+00:00, in addition reported clinically confirmed cases in hubei province and crucially we understand that most of these cases relate to a period going back to the beginning of the outbreak 
2020-02-13 15:38:59+00:00,in the last hours has reported laboratory confirmed cases bringing the total to 
2020-02-13 15:37:13+00:00,daily press conference on with 
2020-02-13 15:28:03+00:00,non lubricated increase risk of hiv stis because they are more likely to tear and they can cause lesions on the vaginal wall 
2020-02-13 14:55:03+00:00,who recommends that with nonoxynol n spermicidal treatment no longer be promoted due to adverse side effects n does not provide extra protection against hiv sti instead it actually increases the risk of hiv infection when used frequently by high risk women 
2020-02-13 14:27:23+00:00,avoid oil based lubricants such as petroleum jelly hand lotion baby oil or edible oils these weaken latex and make them more prone to breakage therefore making them less effective 
2020-02-13 13:57:11+00:00, effectiveness depends on user behaviour in opening the package putting on the condom type of sexual activity lubrication and number of times an individual condom is used condoms are designed for single use only 
2020-02-13 13:29:26+00:00,a very small number of men and women are allergic to latex or to chemicals added to latex these people should not use latex they should be counselled to use synthetic condoms such as polyurethane condoms 
2020-02-13 12:59:10+00:00, can be made of latex polyurethane synthetic material or animal tissue new male and female condoms are being developed by research teams around the world 
2020-02-13 12:28:09+00:00,the female is about the same length as the male condom but is wider for a looser fit allowing freedom in movement that some say provides a more natural feeling lubricant is used on the inside and the outside of female condoms 
2020-02-13 11:51:40+00:00,dyk are available for men and women male condoms are sheaths or coverings that fit over a mans erect penis female condoms are sheaths or linings that fit loosely inside a womans vagina made of thin transparent soft plastic film

2020-02-12 18:37:24+00:00,the full statement by 
2020-02-12 18:36:09+00:00,scientists at the forum also worked with research funders to determine how necessary resources can be mobilized so that critical research can start immediately 
2020-02-12 18:35:58+00:00,over scientists researchers outlined mechanisms for continuing scientific interactions collaborations beyond the meeting which will be coordinated and facilitated by who 
2020-02-12 18:35:45+00:00,all aspects of the outbreak amp ways to control it were discussed r amp d for candidate therapeutics and vaccines ethical considerations for research integration of social sciences into the outbreak response 
2020-02-12 18:35:23+00:00,all aspects of the outbreak amp ways to control it were discussed epidemiological studies clinical characterization amp management of disease caused by the virus infection prevention amp control including best ways to protect 
2020-02-12 18:35:12+00:00,all aspects of the outbreak amp ways to control it were discussed the natural history of the virus its transmission amp diagnosis animal amp environmental research on the origin of the virus including management measures at the human animal interface
2020-02-12 18:34:58+00:00,world experts and funders set priorities for research 
2020-02-12 18:34:24+00:00,the emergency committee on in emphasized the importance of continued support by who and other national and international partners towards the effective implementation and monitoring of these recommendations 
2020-02-12 18:34:00+00:00,the emergency committee on in provided the following advice for all countries 
2020-02-12 18:33:23+00:00,the emergency committee on in provided the following advice for countries at risk 
2020-02-12 18:32:54+00:00,the emergency committee on in provided the following advice for 
2020-02-12 18:30:56+00:00,although the primary concern of the committee is there are serious ongoing outbreaks of other diseases in including measles and cholera the country continues to need support to combat infectious diseases as well as to strengthen its health system 
2020-02-12 18:30:40+00:00,the emergency committee on ebola in acknowledged the revised risk assessment which puts the risk now as high at national and regional levels and low at the global level professor robert steffen 
2020-02-12 18:29:38+00:00,it was the unanimous view of the emergency committee on the outbreak in that the event still constitutes a public health emergency of international concern 
2020-02-12 18:27:49+00:00, finally our advance team in has made good progress in working out the composition of the team and the scope of its work we hope to have more news to announce soon 
2020-02-12 18:27:29+00:00, i ve spoken before about how we have shipped diagnostic kits to laboratories around the world we re also shipping supplies of masks gloves gowns to countries and we have more in the pipeline 
2020-02-12 18:27:11+00:00, we re also doing deeper investigations to identify the source of this virus to prevent further transmission from animals to humans who is now developing a master plan for coordinating clinical trials ensuring they are done coherently and consistently 
2020-02-12 18:26:39+00:00, some of these issues include easy to apply diagnostics the best approaches for infection prevention potential therapies that could be used to treat patients existing vaccine candidates how to accelerate them and how to address the infodemic 
2020-02-12 18:26:15+00:00, as we speak research groups are meeting with the leading research funders to start work immediately on the most pressing questions 
2020-02-12 18:26:02+00:00, as you know the research innovation forum on concluded this afternoon i was very encouraged to see the energy amp speed with which the global research community has taken up this challenge 
2020-02-12 18:25:20+00:00, instead of directing all our energy against the outbreak stigma diverts our attention amp turns people against each other i will say it again this is a time for solidarity not stigma 
2020-02-12 18:25:19+00:00, outbreaks can bring out the best worst in people stigmatizing individuals or entire nations does nothing but harm the response 
2020-02-12 18:24:10+00:00, the ship will arrive in tomorrow morning this afternoon i spoke to s minister of health to thank him for allowing the to dock in his country this is an example of the intl solidarity we have consistently been calling for 
2020-02-12 18:22:43+00:00, i m also pleased to announce that today agreed to accept the which has been stranded at sea for several days based on what we have been told there are no suspected or confirmed cases of on board the westerdam 
2020-02-12 18:21:50+00:00, who has published guidance on how to handle public health events like this on ships and we urge countries and companies to follow that guidance 
2020-02-12 18:21:36+00:00, we have also established lines of communication with the and the major cruise operators to ensure we have accurate information and can provide the right advice 
2020-02-12 18:21:20+00:00, together with the we will issue a communique to all countries to respect the principle of free pratique for ships and the principle of proper care for all travelers in accordance with the international health regulations 
2020-02-12 18:21:06+00:00, unfortunately the is one of three cruise ships that have experienced delayed port clearance or have been denied entry to ports often without an evidence based risk assessment 
2020-02-12 18:20:50+00:00, we are in constant contact with the japanese government the and the owner of the ship to protect the health of all passengers 
2020-02-12 18:20:35+00:00, the number of countries reporting cases has not changed since february of the new cases confirmed outside yesterday were on board the cruise ship which is currently quarantined in yokohama 
2020-02-12 18:20:14+00:00, the number of newly confirmed cases reported from has declined steadily for the past week but that must be interpreted with extreme caution this outbreak could still go in any direction 
2020-02-12 18:19:57+00:00, as of am geneva time this morning there are cases of in with deaths outside there are cases from countries and one death 
2020-02-12 18:19:34+00:00, the current outbreak of highlights why this is so critical our greatest fear remains the damage this coronavirus could do in a country like even as the flames of one outbreak begin to die down we are fighting another fire front 
2020-02-12 18:19:23+00:00, tomorrow i will travel to kinshasa for discussions with the president and other senior ministers about how to strengthen s health system and protect and promote the health of its people 
2020-02-12 18:19:12+00:00, we cant forget that while has killed k people has killed k people in in less time only of health facilities have access to strengthening a health system may not be as sexy as responding to an outbreak but its equally important 
2020-02-12 18:18:59+00:00, nonetheless the signs are extremely positive in the eastern amp i hope that by the time the emergency committee reconvenes we will be able to declare an end to the outbreak but even as we near the end of the outbreak we must act now to prevent the next one 
2020-02-12 18:17:39+00:00, as i said yesterday as long as there is a single case of in an area as insecure amp unstable as eastern the potential remains for a much larger epidemic who s risk assessment is that the risk of spread is high nationally amp regionally amp low globally 
2020-02-12 18:17:23+00:00, the emergency committee on the has advised that the outbreak in continues to be a public health emergency of international concern and i have accepted that advice 
2020-02-12 18:14:38+00:00,press conference on in amp with 
2020-02-12 17:07:49+00:00, has been working with governments airlines media and technology companies to provide accurate health information to the public and to stop rumours about 
2020-02-12 16:26:31+00:00,professor robert steffen is the chairperson of the international health regulations emergency committee on today list of members and advisers of the emergency committee 
2020-02-12 15:54:28+00:00,incident management support teams to coordinate preparedness and response actions have been activated in individual countries and at the regional level including in

2020-02-11 15:20:30+00:00, if we invest now in rational and evidence based interventions we have a realistic chance of stopping the outbreak if we don t we could have far more cases and far higher costs on our hands 
2020-02-11 15:20:09+00:00, we thank those countries that have contributed so far we call on all those who haven t to contribute urgently 
2020-02-11 15:19:38+00:00, it s also important to remember that while we need investment in r d we also need investment in stopping the outbreak now last week who issued a call for million which is what the world needs to support preparedness amp response operations in countries

2020-02-11 15:16:06+00:00, there are many basic public health interventions that are available to us now and which can prevent infections now we ve sent supplies to countries to diagnose and treat patients and protect 
2020-02-11 15:15:41+00:00, the development of vaccines therapeutics is one important part of the research agenda but it is only one part they will take time to develop but in the meantime we are not defenceless 
2020-02-11 15:15:03+00:00, a research roadmap is also important for organizations that fund research to have a clear sense of what the public health priorities are so they can make investments that deliver the biggest public health impact 
2020-02-11 15:14:45+00:00, the main outcome is an agreed roadmap on what questions we need to ask and how we will go about answering those questions this is exactly what who is for bringing the world together to coordinate the response 
2020-02-11 15:14:25+00:00, as you know today and tomorrow who is hosting a meeting of more than scientists from around the world both in person and virtually the main outcome we expect from this meeting is not immediate answers to every question

2020-02-11 15:10:57+00:00, having a name matters to prevent the use of other names that can be inaccurate or stigmatizing it also gives us a standard format to use for any future coronavirus outbreaks 
2020-02-11 15:10:39+00:00, under agreed guidelines between who the amp we had to find a name that did not refer to a geographical location an animal an individual or group of people and which is also pronounceable and related to the disease

2020-02-11 15:07:08+00:00, but until we have no cases for days its not over any single case could re ignite the epidemic and the security situation in eastern remains extremely fragile 
2020-02-11 15:06:49+00:00, although the world is now focused on we cannot and must not forget in we are very encouraged by the current trend there have only been cases in the past week and no cases in the past days

2020-02-11 08:15:59+00:00, we activated the r d blueprint team in early january to coordinate and facilitate information sharing on research elements of the response 
2020-02-11 08:15:33+00:00, following the west african outbreak we developed the who r amp d blueprint a strategy for developing drugs and vaccines before epidemics and accelerating research and development activities during epidemics 
2020-02-11 08:15:21+00:00, there are also tools we don t have we have no vaccine to prevent infections and no proven therapeutics to treat them 
2020-02-11 08:15:06+00:00, what s the best way to manage cases of severe disease what ethical issues we need to be aware of in the way we do our research to defeat this outbreak we need answers to all those questions and more 
2020-02-11 08:15:06+00:00, there is still so much we don t know what are the reservoirs what are the transmission dynamics what is the period of infectiousness which samples should be used for diagnosis amp monitoring of treatment 
2020-02-11 08:14:25+00:00, we need your collective knowledge insight and experience to answer the questions we don t have answers to and to identify the questions we may not even realize we need to ask 
2020-02-11 08:14:11+00:00, and it s a test of scientific solidarity will the world come together to find shared answers to shared problems that s why you re here this is not a meeting about politics or money this is a meeting about science 
2020-02-11 08:14:11+00:00, it s a test of financial solidarity whether the will invest now in fighting the outbreak or pay more later to deal with its consequences 
2020-02-11 08:14:11+00:00, this outbreak is testing us in many ways it s a test of political solidarity whether the world can come together to fight a common enemy that does not respect borders or ideologies

2020-02-07 15:09:43+00:00, we are appreciative of companies that have taken the decision to only supply masks to medical professionals there is limited stock of ppe and we need to make sure we get it to the people who need it most in the places that need it most 
2020-02-07 15:09:25+00:00, i spoke to the pandemic supply chain network which incl manufacturers distributors logistics providers to ensure that ppe supplies get to those who need them the network is focusing initially on surgical masks because of the extreme demand market pressures 
2020-02-07 15:09:00+00:00, who estimates that global frontline health emergency responders will require approximately to of market capacity this percentage may be higher for other critical supplies frontline in require the bulk of ppe supplies 
2020-02-07 15:08:38+00:00, this situation has been exacerbated by widespread inappropriate use of ppe outside patient care as a result there are now depleted stockpiles backlogs of months global stocks of masks respirators are now insufficient to meet the needs of who our partners

2020-02-04 16:41:35+00:00, without better data it s very hard for us to assess how the outbreak is evolving or what impact it could have and to ensure we are providing the most appropriate recommendations 
2020-02-04 16:41:03+00:00, i call on all member states to share detailed information with who including epidemiological clinical severity and the results of community studies and investigations this is the responsibility of all countries under the international health regulations

2020-01-30 19:44:37+00:00, our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems and which are ill prepared to deal with it 
2020-01-30 19:44:16+00:00, the main reason for this declaration is not because of what is happening in but because of what is happening in other countries 
2020-01-30 19:44:02+00:00, breaking for all of these reasons i am declaring a public health emergency of international concern over the global outbreak of
